【與主面對面】

詩集：生命聖詩，486



 




1.	面對面見基督救主，面對面將要如何？

親見為我受死耶穌，面對面何等快樂。


2.	現在見主還不顯明，彷彿黑影隔當中；

不久那福樂日來臨，親見主榮耀聖容。


3.	主同在時何等快樂，憂傷痛苦全消除；

彎曲道路全都修直，隱祕事都要顯露。


4.	面對面歡欣的良辰，面對面萬事知清；

面對面見我救贖主，祂的愛何等豐盛。

副歌：面對面我與主相見，在那遙遠的青天，

　　　面對面在主榮耀中，將來必見主榮面。


[ Face to Face ]

1.	Face to face with Christ, my Savior,

Face to face - what will it be,

When with rapture I behold Him,

Jesus Christ Who died for me?


2.	Only faintly now I see Him,

With the darkened veil between,

But a blessed day is coming,

When His glory shall be seen.


3.	What rejoicing in His presence,

When are banished grief and pain;

When the crooked ways are straightened,

And the dark things shall be plain.


4.	Face to face - oh, blissful moment!

Face to face - to see and know;

Face to face with my Redeemer,

Jesus Christ Who loves me

Refrain:

Face to face I shall behold Him,

Far beyond the starry sky;

Face to face in all His glory,

I shall see Him by and by!so.
