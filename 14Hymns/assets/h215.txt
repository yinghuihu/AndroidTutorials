【教會獨一的根基】

詩集：生命聖詩，215



 




1.	教會獨一的根基，是主耶穌基督，

她是主的新創作，從水與道而出，

主從天上來尋她，作主聖潔新婦，

甘願流自己寶血，捨身將她買贖。


2.	教會雖召自萬邦，信徒卻成一體，

同有救恩的憑證，一主一信一洗，

同尊獨一的聖名，同享唯一天糧，

同懷專一的盼望，同蒙恩愛無量。


3.	教會歷盡了苦難，世人譏笑毀謗，

內爭分裂她身體，異端叛道中傷，

聖徒儆醒爭相問，黑夜到底多長？

哭泣將變為歌唱，轉眼即見晨光。


4.	教會在地卻聯合，真神三位一體，

已享安息的聖徒，奧祕甜蜜團契；

懇求主賜恩我們，能像快樂聖徒，

同樣溫柔且謙虛，與主天上居住。


[ The Church's One Foundation ]

1.	The Church's one foundation is Jesus Christ her Lord;

She is His new creation by water and the Word:

From Heav'n He came and sought her to be His holy bride;

With His own blood He bought her, and for her life He died.


2.	Elect from every nation, yet one o'er all the earth,

Her charter of salvation, one Lord, one faith, one birth;

One holy name she blesses, par-takes one holy food;

And to one hope she presses, With every grace endued.


3.	Though with a scornful wonder Men see her sore oppressed,

By schisms rent asunder, By heresies distressed,

Yet saints their watch are keeping, their cry goes up- "How long?"

But soon the night of weeping shall be the morn of song.


4.	Yet she on earth hath union with God the Three in One,

And mystic sweet communion with those whose rest is won.

O happy ones and holy! Lord, give us grace that we,

Like them, the meek and lowly, on high may dwell with Thee.
