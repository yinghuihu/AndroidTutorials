【來就上主羔羊】

詩集：生命聖詩，198



 




1.	像我這樣，無善可陳，主竟為我流血捨身，

得蒙選召，與你親近，真神羔羊，我來，我來。


2.	像我這樣，罪惡貫盈，不再妄想自我潔淨，

惟你寶血，使我成聖，真神羔羊，我來，我來。


3.	像我這樣，憂愁不安，許多矛盾衝擊疑難，

我心內外恐懼爭戰，真神羔羊，我來，我來。


4.	像我這樣，貧困盲目，求你醫治心靈疾苦，

凡我所需你能滿足，真神羔羊，我來，我來。


5.	像我這樣，你仍恩待，潔淨釋放赦我罪債，

因我真心信你應許，真神羔羊，我來，我來。




[ Just As I Am ]

1.	Just as I am, without one plea,

But that Thy blood was shed for me,

And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


2.	Just as I am, and waiting not

To rid my soul of one dark blot,

To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


3.	Just as I am, though tossed about

With many a conflict, many a doubt,

Fightings and fears within, without,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


4.	Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;

Sight, riches, healing of the mind,

Yea, all I need in Thee to find,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


5.	Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,

Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;

Because Thy promise I believe,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


6.	Just as I am, Thy love unknown

Hath broken every barrier down;

Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
