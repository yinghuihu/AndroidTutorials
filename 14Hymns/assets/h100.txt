【馬槽聖嬰】

詩集：生命聖詩，100


 



1.	遠遠在馬槽裡，無枕也無床，小小的主耶穌，睡覺很安詳；

眾星都照耀著主安睡地方，小小的主耶穌，睡在乾草上。


2.	眾牲畜嗚嗚叫，聖嬰忽驚醒，小小的主耶穌，卻無啼哭聲。

主耶穌，我愛你，求靠近我旁，坐在我小床邊，看守到天亮。


3.	求主來臨近我，與我在一起，愛護我，親近我，永遠不分離。

求主賜福孩童，常關懷看顧，讓我們在天家與耶穌同住。


[ Away In A Manger ]

1.	Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,

The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head;

The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,

The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay.


2.	The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes;

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.

I love you, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky,

And stay by my side until morning is nigh.


3.	Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask you to stay

Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.

Bless all the dear children in your tender care,

And fit us for heaven to live with you there.
