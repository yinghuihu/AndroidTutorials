<Book number="41" name="马可福音" englishName="Mark" chapters="16">
	<Chapter number="1">
		<Line number="1">The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</Line>
		<Line number="2">It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way"--</Line>
		<Line number="3">"a voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</Line>
		<Line number="4">And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</Line>
		<Line number="5">The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</Line>
		<Line number="6">John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</Line>
		<Line number="7">And this was his message: "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</Line>
		<Line number="8">I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</Line>
		<Line number="9">At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</Line>
		<Line number="10">As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</Line>
		<Line number="11">And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</Line>
		<Line number="12">At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,</Line>
		<Line number="13">and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</Line>
		<Line number="14">After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</Line>
		<Line number="15">"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"</Line>
		<Line number="16">As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</Line>
		<Line number="17">"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."</Line>
		<Line number="18">At once they left their nets and followed him.</Line>
		<Line number="19">When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</Line>
		<Line number="20">Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</Line>
		<Line number="21">They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</Line>
		<Line number="22">The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</Line>
		<Line number="23">Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,</Line>
		<Line number="24">"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"</Line>
		<Line number="25">"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</Line>
		<Line number="26">The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</Line>
		<Line number="27">The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."</Line>
		<Line number="28">News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</Line>
		<Line number="29">As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</Line>
		<Line number="30">Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.</Line>
		<Line number="31">So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</Line>
		<Line number="32">That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</Line>
		<Line number="33">The whole town gathered at the door,</Line>
		<Line number="34">and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</Line>
		<Line number="35">Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</Line>
		<Line number="36">Simon and his companions went to look for him,</Line>
		<Line number="37">and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</Line>
		<Line number="38">Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</Line>
		<Line number="39">So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</Line>
		<Line number="40">A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</Line>
		<Line number="41">Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</Line>
		<Line number="42">Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.</Line>
		<Line number="43">Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</Line>
		<Line number="44">"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</Line>
		<Line number="45">Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="2">
		<Line number="1">A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.</Line>
		<Line number="2">So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.</Line>
		<Line number="3">Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.</Line>
		<Line number="4">Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.</Line>
		<Line number="5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</Line>
		<Line number="6">Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,</Line>
		<Line number="7">"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</Line>
		<Line number="8">Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?</Line>
		<Line number="9">Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?</Line>
		<Line number="10">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. . . ." He said to the paralytic,</Line>
		<Line number="11">"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</Line>
		<Line number="12">He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"</Line>
		<Line number="13">Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.</Line>
		<Line number="14">As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</Line>
		<Line number="15">While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</Line>
		<Line number="16">When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "sinners" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"</Line>
		<Line number="17">On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</Line>
		<Line number="18">Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"</Line>
		<Line number="19">Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.</Line>
		<Line number="20">But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.</Line>
		<Line number="21">"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.</Line>
		<Line number="22">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins."</Line>
		<Line number="23">One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.</Line>
		<Line number="24">The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</Line>
		<Line number="25">He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</Line>
		<Line number="26">In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</Line>
		<Line number="27">Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</Line>
		<Line number="28">So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="3">
		<Line number="1">Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.</Line>
		<Line number="2">Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.</Line>
		<Line number="3">Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."</Line>
		<Line number="4">Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.</Line>
		<Line number="5">He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.</Line>
		<Line number="6">Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.</Line>
		<Line number="7">Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.</Line>
		<Line number="8">When they heard all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.</Line>
		<Line number="9">Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.</Line>
		<Line number="10">For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.</Line>
		<Line number="11">Whenever the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God."</Line>
		<Line number="12">But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.</Line>
		<Line number="13">Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.</Line>
		<Line number="14">He appointed twelve--designating them apostles--that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach</Line>
		<Line number="15">and to have authority to drive out demons.</Line>
		<Line number="16">These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);</Line>
		<Line number="17">James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder);</Line>
		<Line number="18">Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot</Line>
		<Line number="19">and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</Line>
		<Line number="20">Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.</Line>
		<Line number="21">When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."</Line>
		<Line number="22">And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."</Line>
		<Line number="23">So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan?</Line>
		<Line number="24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</Line>
		<Line number="25">If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</Line>
		<Line number="26">And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.</Line>
		<Line number="27">In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.</Line>
		<Line number="28">I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.</Line>
		<Line number="29">But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin."</Line>
		<Line number="30">He said this because they were saying, "He has an evil spirit."</Line>
		<Line number="31">Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.</Line>
		<Line number="32">A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."</Line>
		<Line number="33">"Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked.</Line>
		<Line number="34">Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!</Line>
		<Line number="35">Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="4">
		<Line number="1">Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge.</Line>
		<Line number="2">He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:</Line>
		<Line number="3">"Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.</Line>
		<Line number="4">As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</Line>
		<Line number="5">Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</Line>
		<Line number="6">But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</Line>
		<Line number="7">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.</Line>
		<Line number="8">Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times."</Line>
		<Line number="9">Then Jesus said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</Line>
		<Line number="10">When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.</Line>
		<Line number="11">He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables</Line>
		<Line number="12">so that, "'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'"</Line>
		<Line number="13">Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?</Line>
		<Line number="14">The farmer sows the word.</Line>
		<Line number="15">Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</Line>
		<Line number="16">Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.</Line>
		<Line number="17">But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</Line>
		<Line number="18">Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;</Line>
		<Line number="19">but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.</Line>
		<Line number="20">Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown."</Line>
		<Line number="21">He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?</Line>
		<Line number="22">For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.</Line>
		<Line number="23">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."</Line>
		<Line number="24">"Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more.</Line>
		<Line number="25">Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."</Line>
		<Line number="26">He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.</Line>
		<Line number="27">Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.</Line>
		<Line number="28">All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</Line>
		<Line number="29">As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."</Line>
		<Line number="30">Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?</Line>
		<Line number="31">It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground.</Line>
		<Line number="32">Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade."</Line>
		<Line number="33">With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.</Line>
		<Line number="34">He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.</Line>
		<Line number="35">That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."</Line>
		<Line number="36">Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</Line>
		<Line number="37">A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.</Line>
		<Line number="38">Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"</Line>
		<Line number="39">He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.</Line>
		<Line number="40">He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"</Line>
		<Line number="41">They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="5">
		<Line number="1">They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.</Line>
		<Line number="2">When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him.</Line>
		<Line number="3">This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.</Line>
		<Line number="4">For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.</Line>
		<Line number="5">Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</Line>
		<Line number="6">When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.</Line>
		<Line number="7">He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!"</Line>
		<Line number="8">For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"</Line>
		<Line number="9">Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."</Line>
		<Line number="10">And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</Line>
		<Line number="11">A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.</Line>
		<Line number="12">The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."</Line>
		<Line number="13">He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</Line>
		<Line number="14">Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.</Line>
		<Line number="15">When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</Line>
		<Line number="16">Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well.</Line>
		<Line number="17">Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.</Line>
		<Line number="18">As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.</Line>
		<Line number="19">Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."</Line>
		<Line number="20">So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.</Line>
		<Line number="21">When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.</Line>
		<Line number="22">Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet</Line>
		<Line number="23">and pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."</Line>
		<Line number="24">So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.</Line>
		<Line number="25">And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.</Line>
		<Line number="26">She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.</Line>
		<Line number="27">When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,</Line>
		<Line number="28">because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."</Line>
		<Line number="29">Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.</Line>
		<Line number="30">At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</Line>
		<Line number="31">"You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'"</Line>
		<Line number="32">But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.</Line>
		<Line number="33">Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.</Line>
		<Line number="34">He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."</Line>
		<Line number="35">While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher any more?"</Line>
		<Line number="36">Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, "Don't be afraid; just believe."</Line>
		<Line number="37">He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.</Line>
		<Line number="38">When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.</Line>
		<Line number="39">He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."</Line>
		<Line number="40">But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.</Line>
		<Line number="41">He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").</Line>
		<Line number="42">Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.</Line>
		<Line number="43">He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="6">
		<Line number="1">Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.</Line>
		<Line number="2">When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. "Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles!</Line>
		<Line number="3">Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.</Line>
		<Line number="4">Jesus said to them, "Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor."</Line>
		<Line number="5">He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</Line>
		<Line number="6">And he was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.</Line>
		<Line number="7">Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.</Line>
		<Line number="8">These were his instructions: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.</Line>
		<Line number="9">Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.</Line>
		<Line number="10">Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.</Line>
		<Line number="11">And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them."</Line>
		<Line number="12">They went out and preached that people should repent.</Line>
		<Line number="13">They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</Line>
		<Line number="14">King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."</Line>
		<Line number="15">Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."</Line>
		<Line number="16">But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"</Line>
		<Line number="17">For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.</Line>
		<Line number="18">For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</Line>
		<Line number="19">So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,</Line>
		<Line number="20">because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.</Line>
		<Line number="21">Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</Line>
		<Line number="22">When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."</Line>
		<Line number="23">And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."</Line>
		<Line number="24">She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.</Line>
		<Line number="25">At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</Line>
		<Line number="26">The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.</Line>
		<Line number="27">So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,</Line>
		<Line number="28">and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</Line>
		<Line number="29">On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</Line>
		<Line number="30">The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.</Line>
		<Line number="31">Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."</Line>
		<Line number="32">So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.</Line>
		<Line number="33">But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</Line>
		<Line number="34">When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.</Line>
		<Line number="35">By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.</Line>
		<Line number="36">Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."</Line>
		<Line number="37">But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take eight months of a man's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"</Line>
		<Line number="38">"How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five--and two fish."</Line>
		<Line number="39">Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</Line>
		<Line number="40">So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</Line>
		<Line number="41">Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.</Line>
		<Line number="42">They all ate and were satisfied,</Line>
		<Line number="43">and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.</Line>
		<Line number="44">The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.</Line>
		<Line number="45">Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</Line>
		<Line number="46">After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.</Line>
		<Line number="47">When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.</Line>
		<Line number="48">He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,</Line>
		<Line number="49">but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,</Line>
		<Line number="50">because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."</Line>
		<Line number="51">Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,</Line>
		<Line number="52">for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.</Line>
		<Line number="53">When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.</Line>
		<Line number="54">As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.</Line>
		<Line number="55">They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.</Line>
		<Line number="56">And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="7">
		<Line number="1">The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and</Line>
		<Line number="2">saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean," that is, unwashed.</Line>
		<Line number="3">(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.</Line>
		<Line number="4">When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.)</Line>
		<Line number="5">So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?"</Line>
		<Line number="6">He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: "'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</Line>
		<Line number="7">They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'</Line>
		<Line number="8">You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."</Line>
		<Line number="9">And he said to them: "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!</Line>
		<Line number="10">For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'</Line>
		<Line number="11">But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),</Line>
		<Line number="12">then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</Line>
		<Line number="13">Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."</Line>
		<Line number="14">Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</Line>
		<Line number="15">Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'"</Line>
		<Line number="16">[If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.]</Line>
		<Line number="17">After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</Line>
		<Line number="18">"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'?</Line>
		<Line number="19">For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.")</Line>
		<Line number="20">He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.'</Line>
		<Line number="21">For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</Line>
		<Line number="22">greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.</Line>
		<Line number="23">All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'"</Line>
		<Line number="24">Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.</Line>
		<Line number="25">In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet.</Line>
		<Line number="26">The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.</Line>
		<Line number="27">"First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."</Line>
		<Line number="28">"Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."</Line>
		<Line number="29">Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."</Line>
		<Line number="30">She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</Line>
		<Line number="31">Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.</Line>
		<Line number="32">There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.</Line>
		<Line number="33">After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.</Line>
		<Line number="34">He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!").</Line>
		<Line number="35">At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.</Line>
		<Line number="36">Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.</Line>
		<Line number="37">People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="8">
		<Line number="1">During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,</Line>
		<Line number="2">"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</Line>
		<Line number="3">If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance."</Line>
		<Line number="4">His disciples answered, "But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?"</Line>
		<Line number="5">"How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied.</Line>
		<Line number="6">He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people, and they did so.</Line>
		<Line number="7">They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.</Line>
		<Line number="8">The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</Line>
		<Line number="9">About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,</Line>
		<Line number="10">he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</Line>
		<Line number="11">The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven.</Line>
		<Line number="12">He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to it."</Line>
		<Line number="13">Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.</Line>
		<Line number="14">The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.</Line>
		<Line number="15">"Be careful," Jesus warned them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod."</Line>
		<Line number="16">They discussed this with one another and said, "It is because we have no bread."</Line>
		<Line number="17">Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: "Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</Line>
		<Line number="18">Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember?</Line>
		<Line number="19">When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" "Twelve," they replied.</Line>
		<Line number="20">"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" They answered, "Seven."</Line>
		<Line number="21">He said to them, "Do you still not understand?"</Line>
		<Line number="22">They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.</Line>
		<Line number="23">He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?"</Line>
		<Line number="24">He looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around."</Line>
		<Line number="25">Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.</Line>
		<Line number="26">Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't go into the village."</Line>
		<Line number="27">Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"</Line>
		<Line number="28">They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."</Line>
		<Line number="29">"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ."</Line>
		<Line number="30">Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.</Line>
		<Line number="31">He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.</Line>
		<Line number="32">He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</Line>
		<Line number="33">But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. "Get behind me, Satan!" he said. "You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."</Line>
		<Line number="34">Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</Line>
		<Line number="35">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.</Line>
		<Line number="36">What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?</Line>
		<Line number="37">Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</Line>
		<Line number="38">If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="9">
		<Line number="1">And he said to them, "I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power."</Line>
		<Line number="2">After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.</Line>
		<Line number="3">His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.</Line>
		<Line number="4">And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.</Line>
		<Line number="5">Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."</Line>
		<Line number="6">(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)</Line>
		<Line number="7">Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!"</Line>
		<Line number="8">Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.</Line>
		<Line number="9">As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</Line>
		<Line number="10">They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.</Line>
		<Line number="11">And they asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"</Line>
		<Line number="12">Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?</Line>
		<Line number="13">But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him."</Line>
		<Line number="14">When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.</Line>
		<Line number="15">As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.</Line>
		<Line number="16">"What are you arguing with them about?" he asked.</Line>
		<Line number="17">A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.</Line>
		<Line number="18">Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not."</Line>
		<Line number="19">"O unbelieving generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."</Line>
		<Line number="20">So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.</Line>
		<Line number="21">Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?" "From childhood," he answered.</Line>
		<Line number="22">"It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."</Line>
		<Line number="23">"'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for him who believes."</Line>
		<Line number="24">Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"</Line>
		<Line number="25">When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."</Line>
		<Line number="26">The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead."</Line>
		<Line number="27">But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.</Line>
		<Line number="28">After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"</Line>
		<Line number="29">He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer."</Line>
		<Line number="30">They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,</Line>
		<Line number="31">because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."</Line>
		<Line number="32">But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.</Line>
		<Line number="33">They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?"</Line>
		<Line number="34">But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.</Line>
		<Line number="35">Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all."</Line>
		<Line number="36">He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,</Line>
		<Line number="37">"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me."</Line>
		<Line number="38">"Teacher," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us."</Line>
		<Line number="39">"Do not stop him," Jesus said. "No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,</Line>
		<Line number="40">for whoever is not against us is for us.</Line>
		<Line number="41">I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward.</Line>
		<Line number="42">"And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck.</Line>
		<Line number="43">If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.</Line>
		<Line number="44">[Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.]</Line>
		<Line number="45">And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.</Line>
		<Line number="46">[Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.]</Line>
		<Line number="47">And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,</Line>
		<Line number="48">where "'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'</Line>
		<Line number="49">Everyone will be salted with fire.</Line>
		<Line number="50">"Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with each other."</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="10">
		<Line number="1">Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.</Line>
		<Line number="2">Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"</Line>
		<Line number="3">"What did Moses command you?" he replied.</Line>
		<Line number="4">They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."</Line>
		<Line number="5">"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied.</Line>
		<Line number="6">"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.'</Line>
		<Line number="7">'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,</Line>
		<Line number="8">and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one.</Line>
		<Line number="9">Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."</Line>
		<Line number="10">When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.</Line>
		<Line number="11">He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</Line>
		<Line number="12">And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."</Line>
		<Line number="13">People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.</Line>
		<Line number="14">When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</Line>
		<Line number="15">I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."</Line>
		<Line number="16">And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.</Line>
		<Line number="17">As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</Line>
		<Line number="18">"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.</Line>
		<Line number="19">You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'"</Line>
		<Line number="20">"Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy."</Line>
		<Line number="21">Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."</Line>
		<Line number="22">At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.</Line>
		<Line number="23">Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"</Line>
		<Line number="24">The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</Line>
		<Line number="25">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</Line>
		<Line number="26">The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?"</Line>
		<Line number="27">Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."</Line>
		<Line number="28">Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you!"</Line>
		<Line number="29">"I tell you the truth," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel</Line>
		<Line number="30">will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.</Line>
		<Line number="31">But many who are first will be last, and the last first."</Line>
		<Line number="32">They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.</Line>
		<Line number="33">"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</Line>
		<Line number="34">who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."</Line>
		<Line number="35">Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask."</Line>
		<Line number="36">"What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.</Line>
		<Line number="37">They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."</Line>
		<Line number="38">"You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"</Line>
		<Line number="39">"We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,</Line>
		<Line number="40">but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."</Line>
		<Line number="41">When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.</Line>
		<Line number="42">Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</Line>
		<Line number="43">Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</Line>
		<Line number="44">and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.</Line>
		<Line number="45">For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</Line>
		<Line number="46">Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.</Line>
		<Line number="47">When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</Line>
		<Line number="48">Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</Line>
		<Line number="49">Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you."</Line>
		<Line number="50">Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.</Line>
		<Line number="51">"What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."</Line>
		<Line number="52">"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="11">
		<Line number="1">As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,</Line>
		<Line number="2">saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</Line>
		<Line number="3">If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"</Line>
		<Line number="4">They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it,</Line>
		<Line number="5">some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?"</Line>
		<Line number="6">They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.</Line>
		<Line number="7">When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.</Line>
		<Line number="8">Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.</Line>
		<Line number="9">Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"</Line>
		<Line number="10">"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!" "Hosanna in the highest!"</Line>
		<Line number="11">Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</Line>
		<Line number="12">The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.</Line>
		<Line number="13">Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.</Line>
		<Line number="14">Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.</Line>
		<Line number="15">On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,</Line>
		<Line number="16">and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.</Line>
		<Line number="17">And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: "'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"</Line>
		<Line number="18">The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.</Line>
		<Line number="19">When evening came, they went out of the city.</Line>
		<Line number="20">In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</Line>
		<Line number="21">Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!"</Line>
		<Line number="22">"Have faith in God," Jesus answered.</Line>
		<Line number="23">"I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.</Line>
		<Line number="24">Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</Line>
		<Line number="25">And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."</Line>
		<Line number="26">[But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your sins.]</Line>
		<Line number="27">They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.</Line>
		<Line number="28">"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?"</Line>
		<Line number="29">Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</Line>
		<Line number="30">John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!"</Line>
		<Line number="31">They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'</Line>
		<Line number="32">But if we say, 'From men' . . . ." (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)</Line>
		<Line number="33">So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="12">
		<Line number="1">He then began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.</Line>
		<Line number="2">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</Line>
		<Line number="3">But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</Line>
		<Line number="4">Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.</Line>
		<Line number="5">He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.</Line>
		<Line number="6">"He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.'</Line>
		<Line number="7">"But the tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</Line>
		<Line number="8">So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</Line>
		<Line number="9">"What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.</Line>
		<Line number="10">Haven't you read this scripture: "'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone;</Line>
		<Line number="11">the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</Line>
		<Line number="12">Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.</Line>
		<Line number="13">Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.</Line>
		<Line number="14">They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?</Line>
		<Line number="15">Should we pay or shouldn't we?" But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. "Why are you trying to trap me?" he asked. "Bring me a denarius and let me look at it."</Line>
		<Line number="16">They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?" "Caesar's," they replied.</Line>
		<Line number="17">Then Jesus said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.</Line>
		<Line number="18">Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</Line>
		<Line number="19">"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.</Line>
		<Line number="20">Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.</Line>
		<Line number="21">The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third.</Line>
		<Line number="22">In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.</Line>
		<Line number="23">At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"</Line>
		<Line number="24">Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?</Line>
		<Line number="25">When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</Line>
		<Line number="26">Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?</Line>
		<Line number="27">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"</Line>
		<Line number="28">One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"</Line>
		<Line number="29">"The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</Line>
		<Line number="30">Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'</Line>
		<Line number="31">The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."</Line>
		<Line number="32">"Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.</Line>
		<Line number="33">To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."</Line>
		<Line number="34">When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.</Line>
		<Line number="35">While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David?</Line>
		<Line number="36">David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: "'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet." '</Line>
		<Line number="37">David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.</Line>
		<Line number="38">As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces,</Line>
		<Line number="39">and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</Line>
		<Line number="40">They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."</Line>
		<Line number="41">Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.</Line>
		<Line number="42">But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny.</Line>
		<Line number="43">Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.</Line>
		<Line number="44">They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on."</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="13">
		<Line number="1">As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!"</Line>
		<Line number="2">"Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."</Line>
		<Line number="3">As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately,</Line>
		<Line number="4">"Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?"</Line>
		<Line number="5">Jesus said to them: "Watch out that no one deceives you.</Line>
		<Line number="6">Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many.</Line>
		<Line number="7">When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.</Line>
		<Line number="8">Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.</Line>
		<Line number="9">"You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.</Line>
		<Line number="10">And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.</Line>
		<Line number="11">Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</Line>
		<Line number="12">"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.</Line>
		<Line number="13">All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.</Line>
		<Line number="14">"When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</Line>
		<Line number="15">Let no one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out.</Line>
		<Line number="16">Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak.</Line>
		<Line number="17">How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!</Line>
		<Line number="18">Pray that this will not take place in winter,</Line>
		<Line number="19">because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now--and never to be equaled again.</Line>
		<Line number="20">If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.</Line>
		<Line number="21">At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.</Line>
		<Line number="22">For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect--if that were possible.</Line>
		<Line number="23">So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.</Line>
		<Line number="24">"But in those days, following that distress, "'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;</Line>
		<Line number="25">the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'</Line>
		<Line number="26">"At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</Line>
		<Line number="27">And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.</Line>
		<Line number="28">"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.</Line>
		<Line number="29">Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door.</Line>
		<Line number="30">I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.</Line>
		<Line number="31">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</Line>
		<Line number="32">"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.</Line>
		<Line number="33">Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.</Line>
		<Line number="34">It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.</Line>
		<Line number="35">"Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back--whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn.</Line>
		<Line number="36">If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.</Line>
		<Line number="37">What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!'"</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="14">
		<Line number="1">Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him.</Line>
		<Line number="2">"But not during the Feast," they said, "or the people may riot."</Line>
		<Line number="3">While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</Line>
		<Line number="4">Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume?</Line>
		<Line number="5">It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked her harshly.</Line>
		<Line number="6">"Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</Line>
		<Line number="7">The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.</Line>
		<Line number="8">She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.</Line>
		<Line number="9">I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."</Line>
		<Line number="10">Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.</Line>
		<Line number="11">They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.</Line>
		<Line number="12">On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"</Line>
		<Line number="13">So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.</Line>
		<Line number="14">Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'</Line>
		<Line number="15">He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."</Line>
		<Line number="16">The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</Line>
		<Line number="17">When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.</Line>
		<Line number="18">While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."</Line>
		<Line number="19">They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely not I?"</Line>
		<Line number="20">"It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me.</Line>
		<Line number="21">The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."</Line>
		<Line number="22">While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."</Line>
		<Line number="23">Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.</Line>
		<Line number="24">"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them.</Line>
		<Line number="25">"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."</Line>
		<Line number="26">When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</Line>
		<Line number="27">"You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written: "'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'</Line>
		<Line number="28">But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."</Line>
		<Line number="29">Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."</Line>
		<Line number="30">"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times."</Line>
		<Line number="31">But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same.</Line>
		<Line number="32">They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."</Line>
		<Line number="33">He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.</Line>
		<Line number="34">"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch."</Line>
		<Line number="35">Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.</Line>
		<Line number="36">"Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."</Line>
		<Line number="37">Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?</Line>
		<Line number="38">Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."</Line>
		<Line number="39">Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.</Line>
		<Line number="40">When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.</Line>
		<Line number="41">Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</Line>
		<Line number="42">Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"</Line>
		<Line number="43">Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.</Line>
		<Line number="44">Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."</Line>
		<Line number="45">Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.</Line>
		<Line number="46">The men seized Jesus and arrested him.</Line>
		<Line number="47">Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</Line>
		<Line number="48">"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?</Line>
		<Line number="49">Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."</Line>
		<Line number="50">Then everyone deserted him and fled.</Line>
		<Line number="51">A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,</Line>
		<Line number="52">he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.</Line>
		<Line number="53">They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together.</Line>
		<Line number="54">Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.</Line>
		<Line number="55">The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.</Line>
		<Line number="56">Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.</Line>
		<Line number="57">Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:</Line>
		<Line number="58">"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'"</Line>
		<Line number="59">Yet even then their testimony did not agree.</Line>
		<Line number="60">Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"</Line>
		<Line number="61">But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?"</Line>
		<Line number="62">"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."</Line>
		<Line number="63">The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.</Line>
		<Line number="64">"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They all condemned him as worthy of death.</Line>
		<Line number="65">Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.</Line>
		<Line number="66">While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.</Line>
		<Line number="67">When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.</Line>
		<Line number="68">But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway.</Line>
		<Line number="69">When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."</Line>
		<Line number="70">Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."</Line>
		<Line number="71">He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."</Line>
		<Line number="72">Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.</Line>
	</Chapter>
	<Chapter number="15">
		<Line number="1">Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.</Line>
		<Line number="2">"Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</Line>
		<Line number="3">The chief priests accused him of many things.</Line>
		<Line number="4">So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of."</Line>
		<Line number="5">But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.</Line>
		<Line number="6">Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.</Line>
		<Line number="7">A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.</Line>
		<Line number="8">The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.</Line>
		<Line number="9">"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate,</Line>
		<Line number="10">knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</Line>
		<Line number="11">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.</Line>
		<Line number="12">"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them.</Line>
		<Line number="13">"Crucify him!" they shouted.</Line>
		<Line number="14">"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</Line>
		<Line number="15">Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</Line>
		<Line number="16">The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.</Line>
		<Line number="17">They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.</Line>
		<Line number="18">And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!"</Line>
		<Line number="19">Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</Line>
		<Line number="20">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</Line>
		<Line number="21">A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.</Line>
		<Line number="22">They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).</Line>
		<Line number="23">Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.</Line>
		<Line number="24">And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.</Line>
		<Line number="25">It was the third hour when they crucified him.</Line>
		<Line number="26">The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</Line>
		<Line number="27">They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.</Line>
		<Line number="28">[and the scripture was fulfilled which says, "He was counted with the lawless ones" (Isa 53:12)]</Line>
		<Line number="29">Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,</Line>
		<Line number="30">come down from the cross and save yourself!"</Line>
		<Line number="31">In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself!</Line>
		<Line number="32">Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</Line>
		<Line number="33">At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</Line>
		<Line number="34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</Line>
		<Line number="35">When some of those standing near heard this, they said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah."</Line>
		<Line number="36">One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said.</Line>
		<Line number="37">With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</Line>
		<Line number="38">The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</Line>
		<Line number="39">And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"</Line>
		<Line number="40">Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</Line>
		<Line number="41">In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.</Line>
		<Line number="42">It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,</Line>
		<Line number="43">Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.</Line>
		<Line number="44">Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.</Line>
		<Line number="45">When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.</Line>

		<Line number="1">When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.</Line>
		<Line number="2">Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb</Line>
		<Line number="3">and they asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?"</Line>
		<Line number="4">But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.</Line>
		<Line number="5">As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.</Line>
		<Line number="6">"Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.</Line>
		<Line number="7">But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'"</Line>

		<Line number="18">they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."</Line>
