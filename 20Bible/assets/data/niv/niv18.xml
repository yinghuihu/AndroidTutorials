<Book number="18" name="约伯记" englishName="Job" chapters="42">
<Chapter number="1">
<Line number="1">In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.</Line>
<Line number="2">He had seven sons and three daughters,</Line>
<Line number="3">and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.</Line>
<Line number="4">His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</Line>
<Line number="5">When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.</Line>
<Line number="6">One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.</Line>
<Line number="7">The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</Line>
<Line number="8">Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."</Line>
<Line number="9">"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.</Line>
<Line number="10">"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.</Line>
<Line number="11">But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."</Line>
<Line number="12">The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="13">One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</Line>
<Line number="14">a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,</Line>
<Line number="15">and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</Line>
<Line number="16">While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</Line>
<Line number="17">While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</Line>
<Line number="18">While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</Line>
<Line number="19">when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</Line>
<Line number="20">At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship</Line>
<Line number="21">and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."</Line>
<Line number="22">In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="2">
<Line number="1">On another day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.</Line>
<Line number="2">And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</Line>
<Line number="3">Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."</Line>
<Line number="4">"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.</Line>
<Line number="5">But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."</Line>
<Line number="6">The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."</Line>
<Line number="7">So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</Line>
<Line number="8">Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.</Line>
<Line number="9">His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"</Line>
<Line number="10">He replied, "You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.</Line>
<Line number="11">When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.</Line>
<Line number="12">When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.</Line>
<Line number="13">Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="3">
<Line number="1">After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</Line>
<Line number="2">He said:</Line>
<Line number="3">"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, 'A boy is born!'</Line>
<Line number="4">That day--may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.</Line>
<Line number="5">May darkness and deep shadow claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.</Line>
<Line number="6">That night--may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.</Line>
<Line number="7">May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.</Line>
<Line number="8">May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.</Line>
<Line number="9">May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,</Line>
<Line number="10">for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.</Line>
<Line number="11">"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?</Line>
<Line number="12">Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?</Line>
<Line number="13">For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest</Line>
<Line number="14">with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,</Line>
<Line number="15">with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</Line>
<Line number="16">Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?</Line>
<Line number="17">There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.</Line>
<Line number="18">Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.</Line>
<Line number="19">The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.</Line>
<Line number="20">"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,</Line>
<Line number="21">to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,</Line>
<Line number="22">who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?</Line>
<Line number="23">Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</Line>
<Line number="24">For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.</Line>
<Line number="25">What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.</Line>
<Line number="26">I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="4">
<Line number="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?</Line>
<Line number="3">Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.</Line>
<Line number="4">Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.</Line>
<Line number="5">But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.</Line>
<Line number="6">Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?</Line>
<Line number="7">"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?</Line>
<Line number="8">As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.</Line>
<Line number="9">At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.</Line>
<Line number="10">The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.</Line>
<Line number="11">The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</Line>
<Line number="12">"A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.</Line>
<Line number="13">Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</Line>
<Line number="14">fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.</Line>
<Line number="15">A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.</Line>
<Line number="16">It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:</Line>
<Line number="17">'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?</Line>
<Line number="18">If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,</Line>
<Line number="19">how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!</Line>
<Line number="20">Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.</Line>
<Line number="21">Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?'</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="5">
<Line number="1">"Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?</Line>
<Line number="2">Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.</Line>
<Line number="3">I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.</Line>
<Line number="4">His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.</Line>
<Line number="5">The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.</Line>
<Line number="6">For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.</Line>
<Line number="7">Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.</Line>
<Line number="8">"But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.</Line>
<Line number="9">He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.</Line>
<Line number="10">He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside.</Line>
<Line number="11">The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.</Line>
<Line number="12">He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.</Line>
<Line number="13">He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.</Line>
<Line number="14">Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.</Line>
<Line number="15">He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.</Line>
<Line number="16">So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.</Line>
<Line number="17">"Blessed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.</Line>
<Line number="18">For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.</Line>
<Line number="19">From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will befall you.</Line>
<Line number="20">In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.</Line>
<Line number="21">You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.</Line>
<Line number="22">You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.</Line>
<Line number="23">For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.</Line>
<Line number="24">You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.</Line>
<Line number="25">You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.</Line>
<Line number="26">You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season.</Line>
<Line number="27">"We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="6">
<Line number="1">Then Job replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!</Line>
<Line number="3">It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas--no wonder my words have been impetuous.</Line>
<Line number="4">The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.</Line>
<Line number="5">Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?</Line>
<Line number="6">Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg?</Line>
<Line number="7">I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.</Line>
<Line number="8">"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,</Line>
<Line number="9">that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!</Line>
<Line number="10">Then I would still have this consolation--my joy in unrelenting pain--that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.</Line>
<Line number="11">"What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?</Line>
<Line number="12">Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?</Line>
<Line number="13">Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?</Line>
<Line number="14">"A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</Line>
<Line number="15">But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow</Line>
<Line number="16">when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,</Line>
<Line number="17">but that cease to flow in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.</Line>
<Line number="18">Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go up into the wasteland and perish.</Line>
<Line number="19">The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.</Line>
<Line number="20">They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.</Line>
<Line number="21">Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.</Line>
<Line number="22">Have I ever said, 'Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,</Line>
<Line number="23">deliver me from the hand of the enemy, ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless'?</Line>
<Line number="24">"Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.</Line>
<Line number="25">How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?</Line>
<Line number="26">Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?</Line>
<Line number="27">You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.</Line>
<Line number="28">"But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?</Line>
<Line number="29">Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.</Line>
<Line number="30">Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice?</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="7">
<Line number="1">"Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired man?</Line>
<Line number="2">Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages,</Line>
<Line number="3">so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.</Line>
<Line number="4">When I lie down I think, 'How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss till dawn.</Line>
<Line number="5">My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering.</Line>
<Line number="6">"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.</Line>
<Line number="7">Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again.</Line>
<Line number="8">The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.</Line>
<Line number="9">As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.</Line>
<Line number="10">He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more.</Line>
<Line number="11">"Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</Line>
<Line number="12">Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?</Line>
<Line number="13">When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,</Line>
<Line number="14">even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,</Line>
<Line number="15">so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.</Line>
<Line number="16">I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.</Line>
<Line number="17">"What is man that you make so much of him, that you give him so much attention,</Line>
<Line number="18">that you examine him every morning and test him every moment?</Line>
<Line number="19">Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?</Line>
<Line number="20">If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?</Line>
<Line number="21">Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="8">
<Line number="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.</Line>
<Line number="3">Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?</Line>
<Line number="4">When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.</Line>
<Line number="5">But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty,</Line>
<Line number="6">if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.</Line>
<Line number="7">Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be.</Line>
<Line number="8">"Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned,</Line>
<Line number="9">for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.</Line>
<Line number="10">Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?</Line>
<Line number="11">Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?</Line>
<Line number="12">While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.</Line>
<Line number="13">Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.</Line>
<Line number="14">What he trusts in is fragile; what he relies on is a spider's web.</Line>
<Line number="15">He leans on his web, but it gives way; he clings to it, but it does not hold.</Line>
<Line number="16">He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;</Line>
<Line number="17">it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.</Line>
<Line number="18">But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, 'I never saw you.'</Line>
<Line number="19">Surely its life withers away, and from the soil other plants grow.</Line>
<Line number="20">"Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.</Line>
<Line number="21">He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.</Line>
<Line number="22">Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="9">
<Line number="1">Then Job replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?</Line>
<Line number="3">Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.</Line>
<Line number="4">His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?</Line>
<Line number="5">He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.</Line>
<Line number="6">He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.</Line>
<Line number="7">He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.</Line>
<Line number="8">He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.</Line>
<Line number="9">He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.</Line>
<Line number="10">He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.</Line>
<Line number="11">When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.</Line>
<Line number="12">If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?'</Line>
<Line number="13">God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.</Line>
<Line number="14">"How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?</Line>
<Line number="15">Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.</Line>
<Line number="16">Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.</Line>
<Line number="17">He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.</Line>
<Line number="18">He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.</Line>
<Line number="19">If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him?</Line>
<Line number="20">Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.</Line>
<Line number="21">"Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.</Line>
<Line number="22">It is all the same; that is why I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'</Line>
<Line number="23">When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.</Line>
<Line number="24">When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it?</Line>
<Line number="25">"My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.</Line>
<Line number="26">They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.</Line>
<Line number="27">If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,'</Line>
<Line number="28">I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.</Line>
<Line number="29">Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?</Line>
<Line number="30">Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with washing soda,</Line>
<Line number="31">you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.</Line>
<Line number="32">"He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.</Line>
<Line number="33">If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both,</Line>
<Line number="34">someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.</Line>
<Line number="35">Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="10">
<Line number="1">"I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.</Line>
<Line number="2">I will say to God: Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me.</Line>
<Line number="3">Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the schemes of the wicked?</Line>
<Line number="4">Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees?</Line>
<Line number="5">Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a man,</Line>
<Line number="6">that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin--</Line>
<Line number="7">though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand?</Line>
<Line number="8">"Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?</Line>
<Line number="9">Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?</Line>
<Line number="10">Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese,</Line>
<Line number="11">clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?</Line>
<Line number="12">You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit.</Line>
<Line number="13">"But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind:</Line>
<Line number="14">If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.</Line>
<Line number="15">If I am guilty--woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and drowned in my affliction.</Line>
<Line number="16">If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me.</Line>
<Line number="17">You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave.</Line>
<Line number="18">"Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me.</Line>
<Line number="19">If only I had never come into being, or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!</Line>
<Line number="20">Are not my few days almost over? Turn away from me so I can have a moment's joy</Line>
<Line number="21">before I go to the place of no return, to the land of gloom and deep shadow,</Line>
<Line number="22">to the land of deepest night, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="11">
<Line number="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?</Line>
<Line number="3">Will your idle talk reduce men to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock?</Line>
<Line number="4">You say to God, 'My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.'</Line>
<Line number="5">Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you</Line>
<Line number="6">and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.</Line>
<Line number="7">"Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?</Line>
<Line number="8">They are higher than the heavens--what can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave--what can you know?</Line>
<Line number="9">Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.</Line>
<Line number="10">"If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him?</Line>
<Line number="11">Surely he recognizes deceitful men; and when he sees evil, does he not take note?</Line>
<Line number="12">But a witless man can no more become wise than a wild donkey's colt can be born a man.</Line>
<Line number="13">"Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,</Line>
<Line number="14">if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,</Line>
<Line number="15">then you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.</Line>
<Line number="16">You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by.</Line>
<Line number="17">Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.</Line>
<Line number="18">You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety.</Line>
<Line number="19">You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor.</Line>
<Line number="20">But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="12">
<Line number="1">Then Job replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!</Line>
<Line number="3">But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things?</Line>
<Line number="4">"I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called upon God and he answered--a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!</Line>
<Line number="5">Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.</Line>
<Line number="6">The tents of marauders are undisturbed, and those who provoke God are secure--those who carry their god in their hands.</Line>
<Line number="7">"But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you;</Line>
<Line number="8">or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you.</Line>
<Line number="9">Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?</Line>
<Line number="10">In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.</Line>
<Line number="11">Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?</Line>
<Line number="12">Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?</Line>
<Line number="13">"To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.</Line>
<Line number="14">What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man he imprisons cannot be released.</Line>
<Line number="15">If he holds back the waters, there is drought; if he lets them loose, they devastate the land.</Line>
<Line number="16">To him belong strength and victory; both deceived and deceiver are his.</Line>
<Line number="17">He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.</Line>
<Line number="18">He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth around their waist.</Line>
<Line number="19">He leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established.</Line>
<Line number="20">He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.</Line>
<Line number="21">He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.</Line>
<Line number="22">He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light.</Line>
<Line number="23">He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them.</Line>
<Line number="24">He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; he sends them wandering through a trackless waste.</Line>
<Line number="25">They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="13">
<Line number="1">"My eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it.</Line>
<Line number="2">What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.</Line>
<Line number="3">But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God.</Line>
<Line number="4">You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you!</Line>
<Line number="5">If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom.</Line>
<Line number="6">Hear now my argument; listen to the plea of my lips.</Line>
<Line number="7">Will you speak wickedly on God's behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him?</Line>
<Line number="8">Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God?</Line>
<Line number="9">Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive men?</Line>
<Line number="10">He would surely rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.</Line>
<Line number="11">Would not his splendor terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you?</Line>
<Line number="12">Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.</Line>
<Line number="13">"Keep silent and let me speak; then let come to me what may.</Line>
<Line number="14">Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands?</Line>
<Line number="15">Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; I will surely defend my ways to his face.</Line>
<Line number="16">Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, for no godless man would dare come before him!</Line>
<Line number="17">Listen carefully to my words; let your ears take in what I say.</Line>
<Line number="18">Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated.</Line>
<Line number="19">Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die.</Line>
<Line number="20">"Only grant me these two things, O God, and then I will not hide from you:</Line>
<Line number="21">Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors.</Line>
<Line number="22">Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply.</Line>
<Line number="23">How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my offense and my sin.</Line>
<Line number="24">Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy?</Line>
<Line number="25">Will you torment a windblown leaf? Will you chase after dry chaff?</Line>
<Line number="26">For you write down bitter things against me and make me inherit the sins of my youth.</Line>
<Line number="27">You fasten my feet in shackles; you keep close watch on all my paths by putting marks on the soles of my feet.</Line>
<Line number="28">"So man wastes away like something rotten, like a garment eaten by moths.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="14">
<Line number="1">"Man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.</Line>
<Line number="2">He springs up like a flower and withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.</Line>
<Line number="3">Do you fix your eye on such a one? Will you bring him before you for judgment?</Line>
<Line number="4">Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!</Line>
<Line number="5">Man's days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.</Line>
<Line number="6">So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired man.</Line>
<Line number="7">"At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.</Line>
<Line number="8">Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil,</Line>
<Line number="9">yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant.</Line>
<Line number="10">But man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more.</Line>
<Line number="11">As water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,</Line>
<Line number="12">so man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.</Line>
<Line number="13">"If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me!</Line>
<Line number="14">If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.</Line>
<Line number="15">You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made.</Line>
<Line number="16">Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.</Line>
<Line number="17">My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin.</Line>
<Line number="18">"But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place,</Line>
<Line number="19">as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man's hope.</Line>
<Line number="20">You overpower him once for all, and he is gone; you change his countenance and send him away.</Line>
<Line number="21">If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it.</Line>
<Line number="22">He feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="15">
<Line number="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind?</Line>
<Line number="3">Would he argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?</Line>
<Line number="4">But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.</Line>
<Line number="5">Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.</Line>
<Line number="6">Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you.</Line>
<Line number="7">"Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?</Line>
<Line number="8">Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</Line>
<Line number="9">What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?</Line>
<Line number="10">The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father.</Line>
<Line number="11">Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?</Line>
<Line number="12">Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,</Line>
<Line number="13">so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?</Line>
<Line number="14">"What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous?</Line>
<Line number="15">If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,</Line>
<Line number="16">how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks up evil like water!</Line>
<Line number="17">"Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,</Line>
<Line number="18">what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received from their fathers</Line>
<Line number="19">(to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed among them):</Line>
<Line number="20">All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all the years stored up for him.</Line>
<Line number="21">Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.</Line>
<Line number="22">He despairs of escaping the darkness; he is marked for the sword.</Line>
<Line number="23">He wanders about--food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.</Line>
<Line number="24">Distress and anguish fill him with terror; they overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,</Line>
<Line number="25">because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,</Line>
<Line number="26">defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield.</Line>
<Line number="27">"Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,</Line>
<Line number="28">he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble.</Line>
<Line number="29">He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.</Line>
<Line number="30">He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away.</Line>
<Line number="31">Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return.</Line>
<Line number="32">Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish.</Line>
<Line number="33">He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.</Line>
<Line number="34">For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.</Line>
<Line number="35">They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="16">
<Line number="1">Then Job replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all!</Line>
<Line number="3">Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?</Line>
<Line number="4">I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you.</Line>
<Line number="5">But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief.</Line>
<Line number="6">"Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away.</Line>
<Line number="7">Surely, O God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household.</Line>
<Line number="8">You have bound me--and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.</Line>
<Line number="9">God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.</Line>
<Line number="10">Men open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.</Line>
<Line number="11">God has turned me over to evil men and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.</Line>
<Line number="12">All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target;</Line>
<Line number="13">his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground.</Line>
<Line number="14">Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior.</Line>
<Line number="15">"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.</Line>
<Line number="16">My face is red with weeping, deep shadows ring my eyes;</Line>
<Line number="17">yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure.</Line>
<Line number="18">"O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest!</Line>
<Line number="19">Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.</Line>
<Line number="20">My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God;</Line>
<Line number="21">on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend.</Line>
<Line number="22">"Only a few years will pass before I go on the journey of no return.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="17">
<Line number="1">My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me.</Line>
<Line number="2">Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility.</Line>
<Line number="3">"Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?</Line>
<Line number="4">You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph.</Line>
<Line number="5">If a man denounces his friends for reward, the eyes of his children will fail.</Line>
<Line number="6">"God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit.</Line>
<Line number="7">My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow.</Line>
<Line number="8">Upright men are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.</Line>
<Line number="9">Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.</Line>
<Line number="10">"But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you.</Line>
<Line number="11">My days have passed, my plans are shattered, and so are the desires of my heart.</Line>
<Line number="12">These men turn night into day; in the face of darkness they say, 'Light is near.'</Line>
<Line number="13">If the only home I hope for is the grave, if I spread out my bed in darkness,</Line>
<Line number="14">if I say to corruption, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother' or 'My sister,'</Line>
<Line number="15">where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?</Line>
<Line number="16">Will it go down to the gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?"</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="18">
<Line number="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk.</Line>
<Line number="3">Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight?</Line>
<Line number="4">You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place?</Line>
<Line number="5">"The lamp of the wicked is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning.</Line>
<Line number="6">The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out.</Line>
<Line number="7">The vigor of his step is weakened; his own schemes throw him down.</Line>
<Line number="8">His feet thrust him into a net and he wanders into its mesh.</Line>
<Line number="9">A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast.</Line>
<Line number="10">A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path.</Line>
<Line number="11">Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step.</Line>
<Line number="12">Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for him when he falls.</Line>
<Line number="13">It eats away parts of his skin; death's firstborn devours his limbs.</Line>
<Line number="14">He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors.</Line>
<Line number="15">Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.</Line>
<Line number="16">His roots dry up below and his branches wither above.</Line>
<Line number="17">The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land.</Line>
<Line number="18">He is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world.</Line>
<Line number="19">He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived.</Line>
<Line number="20">Men of the west are appalled at his fate; men of the east are seized with horror.</Line>
<Line number="21">Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; such is the place of one who knows not God."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="19">
<Line number="1">Then Job replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"How long will you torment me and crush me with words?</Line>
<Line number="3">Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me.</Line>
<Line number="4">If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone.</Line>
<Line number="5">If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me,</Line>
<Line number="6">then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me.</Line>
<Line number="7">"Though I cry, 'I've been wronged!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.</Line>
<Line number="8">He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness.</Line>
<Line number="9">He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.</Line>
<Line number="10">He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree.</Line>
<Line number="11">His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies.</Line>
<Line number="12">His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.</Line>
<Line number="13">"He has alienated my brothers from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.</Line>
<Line number="14">My kinsmen have gone away; my friends have forgotten me.</Line>
<Line number="15">My guests and my maidservants count me a stranger; they look upon me as an alien.</Line>
<Line number="16">I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth.</Line>
<Line number="17">My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own brothers.</Line>
<Line number="18">Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me.</Line>
<Line number="19">All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me.</Line>
<Line number="20">I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth.</Line>
<Line number="21">"Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.</Line>
<Line number="22">Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?</Line>
<Line number="23">"Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll,</Line>
<Line number="24">that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!</Line>
<Line number="25">I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth.</Line>
<Line number="26">And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God;</Line>
<Line number="27">I myself will see him with my own eyes--I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!</Line>
<Line number="28">"If you say, 'How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him,'</Line>
<Line number="29">you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="20">
<Line number="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed.</Line>
<Line number="3">I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and my understanding inspires me to reply.</Line>
<Line number="4">"Surely you know how it has been from of old, ever since man was placed on the earth,</Line>
<Line number="5">that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.</Line>
<Line number="6">Though his pride reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds,</Line>
<Line number="7">he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'</Line>
<Line number="8">Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night.</Line>
<Line number="9">The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more.</Line>
<Line number="10">His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth.</Line>
<Line number="11">The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.</Line>
<Line number="12">"Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue,</Line>
<Line number="13">though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,</Line>
<Line number="14">yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him.</Line>
<Line number="15">He will spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit them up.</Line>
<Line number="16">He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him.</Line>
<Line number="17">He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.</Line>
<Line number="18">What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.</Line>
<Line number="19">For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute; he has seized houses he did not build.</Line>
<Line number="20">"Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure.</Line>
<Line number="21">Nothing is left for him to devour; his prosperity will not endure.</Line>
<Line number="22">In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him.</Line>
<Line number="23">When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows upon him.</Line>
<Line number="24">Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.</Line>
<Line number="25">He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him;</Line>
<Line number="26">total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.</Line>
<Line number="27">The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him.</Line>
<Line number="28">A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters on the day of God's wrath.</Line>
<Line number="29">Such is the fate God allots the wicked, the heritage appointed for them by God."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="21">
<Line number="1">Then Job replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you give me.</Line>
<Line number="3">Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.</Line>
<Line number="4">"Is my complaint directed to man? Why should I not be impatient?</Line>
<Line number="5">Look at me and be astonished; clap your hand over your mouth.</Line>
<Line number="6">When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body.</Line>
<Line number="7">Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?</Line>
<Line number="8">They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes.</Line>
<Line number="9">Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not upon them.</Line>
<Line number="10">Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.</Line>
<Line number="11">They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.</Line>
<Line number="12">They sing to the music of tambourine and harp; they make merry to the sound of the flute.</Line>
<Line number="13">They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.</Line>
<Line number="14">Yet they say to God, 'Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways.</Line>
<Line number="15">Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?'</Line>
<Line number="16">But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.</Line>
<Line number="17">"Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?</Line>
<Line number="18">How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?</Line>
<Line number="19">It is said,'God stores up a man's punishment for his sons.' Let him repay the man himself, so that he will know it!</Line>
<Line number="20">Let his own eyes see his destruction; let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</Line>
<Line number="21">For what does he care about the family he leaves behind when his allotted months come to an end?</Line>
<Line number="22">"Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he judges even the highest?</Line>
<Line number="23">One man dies in full vigor, completely secure and at ease,</Line>
<Line number="24">his body well nourished, his bones rich with marrow.</Line>
<Line number="25">Another man dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good.</Line>
<Line number="26">Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both.</Line>
<Line number="27">"I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me.</Line>
<Line number="28">You say, 'Where now is the great man's house, the tents where wicked men lived?'</Line>
<Line number="29">Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts--</Line>
<Line number="30">that the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, that he is delivered from the day of wrath?</Line>
<Line number="31">Who denounces his conduct to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?</Line>
<Line number="32">He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.</Line>
<Line number="33">The soil in the valley is sweet to him; all men follow after him, and a countless throng goes before him.</Line>
<Line number="34">"So how can you console me with your nonsense? Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!"</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="22">
<Line number="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise man benefit him?</Line>
<Line number="3">What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?</Line>
<Line number="4">"Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?</Line>
<Line number="5">Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?</Line>
<Line number="6">You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked.</Line>
<Line number="7">You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,</Line>
<Line number="8">though you were a powerful man, owning land--an honored man, living on it.</Line>
<Line number="9">And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.</Line>
<Line number="10">That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,</Line>
<Line number="11">why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.</Line>
<Line number="12">"Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!</Line>
<Line number="13">Yet you say, 'What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness?</Line>
<Line number="14">Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.'</Line>
<Line number="15">Will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod?</Line>
<Line number="16">They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.</Line>
<Line number="17">They said to God, 'Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?'</Line>
<Line number="18">Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.</Line>
<Line number="19">"The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,</Line>
<Line number="20">'Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.'</Line>
<Line number="21">"Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.</Line>
<Line number="22">Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.</Line>
<Line number="23">If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent</Line>
<Line number="24">and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,</Line>
<Line number="25">then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you.</Line>
<Line number="26">Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.</Line>
<Line number="27">You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.</Line>
<Line number="28">What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways.</Line>
<Line number="29">When men are brought low and you say, 'Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast.</Line>
<Line number="30">He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="23">
<Line number="1">Then Job replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.</Line>
<Line number="3">If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!</Line>
<Line number="4">I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.</Line>
<Line number="5">I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say.</Line>
<Line number="6">Would he oppose me with great power? No, he would not press charges against me.</Line>
<Line number="7">There an upright man could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.</Line>
<Line number="8">"But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him.</Line>
<Line number="9">When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.</Line>
<Line number="10">But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.</Line>
<Line number="11">My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.</Line>
<Line number="12">I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.</Line>
<Line number="13">"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.</Line>
<Line number="14">He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.</Line>
<Line number="15">That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him.</Line>
<Line number="16">God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.</Line>
<Line number="17">Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="24">
<Line number="1">"Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?</Line>
<Line number="2">Men move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen.</Line>
<Line number="3">They drive away the orphan's donkey and take the widow's ox in pledge.</Line>
<Line number="4">They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.</Line>
<Line number="5">Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.</Line>
<Line number="6">They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.</Line>
<Line number="7">Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.</Line>
<Line number="8">They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.</Line>
<Line number="9">The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.</Line>
<Line number="10">Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.</Line>
<Line number="11">They crush olives among the terraces; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.</Line>
<Line number="12">The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. But God charges no one with wrongdoing.</Line>
<Line number="13">"There are those who rebel against the light, who do not know its ways or stay in its paths.</Line>
<Line number="14">When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up and kills the poor and needy; in the night he steals forth like a thief.</Line>
<Line number="15">The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, 'No eye will see me,' and he keeps his face concealed.</Line>
<Line number="16">In the dark, men break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light.</Line>
<Line number="17">For all of them, deep darkness is their morning; they make friends with the terrors of darkness.</Line>
<Line number="18">"Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one goes to the vineyards.</Line>
<Line number="19">As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so the grave snatches away those who have sinned.</Line>
<Line number="20">The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; evil men are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree.</Line>
<Line number="21">They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow show no kindness.</Line>
<Line number="22">But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life.</Line>
<Line number="23">He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways.</Line>
<Line number="24">For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.</Line>
<Line number="25">"If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?"</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="25">
<Line number="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven.</Line>
<Line number="3">Can his forces be numbered? Upon whom does his light not rise?</Line>
<Line number="4">How then can a man be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?</Line>
<Line number="5">If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes,</Line>
<Line number="6">how much less man, who is but a maggot--a son of man, who is only a worm!"</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="26">
<Line number="1">Then Job replied:</Line>
<Line number="2">"How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!</Line>
<Line number="3">What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed!</Line>
<Line number="4">Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?</Line>
<Line number="5">"The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them.</Line>
<Line number="6">Death is naked before God; Destruction lies uncovered.</Line>
<Line number="7">He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing.</Line>
<Line number="8">He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.</Line>
<Line number="9">He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it.</Line>
<Line number="10">He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.</Line>
<Line number="11">The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke.</Line>
<Line number="12">By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.</Line>
<Line number="13">By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.</Line>
<Line number="14">And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?"</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="27">
<Line number="1">And Job continued his discourse:</Line>
<Line number="2">"As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made me taste bitterness of soul,</Line>
<Line number="3">as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils,</Line>
<Line number="4">my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will utter no deceit.</Line>
<Line number="5">I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity.</Line>
<Line number="6">I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.</Line>
<Line number="7">"May my enemies be like the wicked, my adversaries like the unjust!</Line>
<Line number="8">For what hope has the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?</Line>
<Line number="9">Does God listen to his cry when distress comes upon him?</Line>
<Line number="10">Will he find delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?</Line>
<Line number="11">"I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.</Line>
<Line number="12">You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk?</Line>
<Line number="13">"Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:</Line>
<Line number="14">However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat.</Line>
<Line number="15">The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them.</Line>
<Line number="16">Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay,</Line>
<Line number="17">what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver.</Line>
<Line number="18">The house he builds is like a moth's cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman.</Line>
<Line number="19">He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.</Line>
<Line number="20">Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night.</Line>
<Line number="21">The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.</Line>
<Line number="22">It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.</Line>
<Line number="23">It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="28">
<Line number="1">"There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.</Line>
<Line number="2">Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.</Line>
<Line number="3">Man puts an end to the darkness; he searches the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.</Line>
<Line number="4">Far from where people dwell he cuts a shaft, in places forgotten by the foot of man; far from men he dangles and sways.</Line>
<Line number="5">The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire;</Line>
<Line number="6">sapphires come from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold.</Line>
<Line number="7">No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon's eye has seen it.</Line>
<Line number="8">Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there.</Line>
<Line number="9">Man's hand assaults the flinty rock and lays bare the roots of the mountains.</Line>
<Line number="10">He tunnels through the rock; his eyes see all its treasures.</Line>
<Line number="11">He searches the sources of the rivers and brings hidden things to light.</Line>
<Line number="12">"But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?</Line>
<Line number="13">Man does not comprehend its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living.</Line>
<Line number="14">The deep says, 'It is not in me'; the sea says, 'It is not with me.'</Line>
<Line number="15">It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed in silver.</Line>
<Line number="16">It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or sapphires.</Line>
<Line number="17">Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold.</Line>
<Line number="18">Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.</Line>
<Line number="19">The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold.</Line>
<Line number="20">"Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell?</Line>
<Line number="21">It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds of the air.</Line>
<Line number="22">Destruction and Death say, 'Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.'</Line>
<Line number="23">God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells,</Line>
<Line number="24">for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.</Line>
<Line number="25">When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters,</Line>
<Line number="26">when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm,</Line>
<Line number="27">then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it.</Line>
<Line number="28">And he said to man, 'The fear of the Lord--that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.'"</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="29">
<Line number="1">Job continued his discourse:</Line>
<Line number="2">"How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,</Line>
<Line number="3">when his lamp shone upon my head and by his light I walked through darkness!</Line>
<Line number="4">Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God's intimate friendship blessed my house,</Line>
<Line number="5">when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,</Line>
<Line number="6">when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.</Line>
<Line number="7">"When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square,</Line>
<Line number="8">the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet;</Line>
<Line number="9">the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands;</Line>
<Line number="10">the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.</Line>
<Line number="11">Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me,</Line>
<Line number="12">because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist him.</Line>
<Line number="13">The man who was dying blessed me; I made the widow's heart sing.</Line>
<Line number="14">I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban.</Line>
<Line number="15">I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.</Line>
<Line number="16">I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger.</Line>
<Line number="17">I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.</Line>
<Line number="18">"I thought, 'I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand.</Line>
<Line number="19">My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.</Line>
<Line number="20">My glory will remain fresh in me, the bow ever new in my hand.'</Line>
<Line number="21">"Men listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel.</Line>
<Line number="22">After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears.</Line>
<Line number="23">They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.</Line>
<Line number="24">When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them.</Line>
<Line number="25">I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="30">
<Line number="1">"But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.</Line>
<Line number="2">Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?</Line>
<Line number="3">Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.</Line>
<Line number="4">In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food was the root of the broom tree.</Line>
<Line number="5">They were banished from their fellow men, shouted at as if they were thieves.</Line>
<Line number="6">They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.</Line>
<Line number="7">They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.</Line>
<Line number="8">A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land.</Line>
<Line number="9">"And now their sons mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.</Line>
<Line number="10">They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.</Line>
<Line number="11">Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence.</Line>
<Line number="12">On my right the tribe attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me.</Line>
<Line number="13">They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me--without anyone's helping them.</Line>
<Line number="14">They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.</Line>
<Line number="15">Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud.</Line>
<Line number="16">"And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me.</Line>
<Line number="17">Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest.</Line>
<Line number="18">In his great power God becomes like clothing to me; he binds me like the neck of my garment.</Line>
<Line number="19">He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes.</Line>
<Line number="20">"I cry out to you, O God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me.</Line>
<Line number="21">You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me.</Line>
<Line number="22">You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm.</Line>
<Line number="23">I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.</Line>
<Line number="24">"Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.</Line>
<Line number="25">Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?</Line>
<Line number="26">Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.</Line>
<Line number="27">The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me.</Line>
<Line number="28">I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.</Line>
<Line number="29">I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls.</Line>
<Line number="30">My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever.</Line>
<Line number="31">My harp is tuned to mourning, and my flute to the sound of wailing.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="31">
<Line number="1">"I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl.</Line>
<Line number="2">For what is man's lot from God above, his heritage from the Almighty on high?</Line>
<Line number="3">Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong?</Line>
<Line number="4">Does he not see my ways and count my every step?</Line>
<Line number="5">"If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit--</Line>
<Line number="6">let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless--</Line>
<Line number="7">if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled,</Line>
<Line number="8">then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.</Line>
<Line number="9">"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door,</Line>
<Line number="10">then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her.</Line>
<Line number="11">For that would have been shameful, a sin to be judged.</Line>
<Line number="12">It is a fire that burns to Destruction; it would have uprooted my harvest.</Line>
<Line number="13">"If I have denied justice to my menservants and maidservants when they had a grievance against me,</Line>
<Line number="14">what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account?</Line>
<Line number="15">Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?</Line>
<Line number="16">"If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary,</Line>
<Line number="17">if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless--</Line>
<Line number="18">but from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my birth I guided the widow--</Line>
<Line number="19">if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a garment,</Line>
<Line number="20">and his heart did not bless me for warming him with the fleece from my sheep,</Line>
<Line number="21">if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court,</Line>
<Line number="22">then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint.</Line>
<Line number="23">For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.</Line>
<Line number="24">"If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, 'You are my security,'</Line>
<Line number="25">if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained,</Line>
<Line number="26">if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,</Line>
<Line number="27">so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,</Line>
<Line number="28">then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high.</Line>
<Line number="29">"If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him--</Line>
<Line number="30">I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against his life--</Line>
<Line number="31">if the men of my household have never said, 'Who has not had his fill of Job's meat?'--</Line>
<Line number="32">but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler--</Line>
<Line number="33">if I have concealed my sin as men do, by hiding my guilt in my heart</Line>
<Line number="34">because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside</Line>
<Line number="35">("Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense--let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing.</Line>
<Line number="36">Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown.</Line>
<Line number="37">I would give him an account of my every step; like a prince I would approach him.)--</Line>
<Line number="38">"if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears,</Line>
<Line number="39">if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,</Line>
<Line number="40">then let briers come up instead of wheat and weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="32">
<Line number="1">So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</Line>
<Line number="2">But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.</Line>
<Line number="3">He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.</Line>
<Line number="4">Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.</Line>
<Line number="5">But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.</Line>
<Line number="6">So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.</Line>
<Line number="7">I thought, 'Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.'</Line>
<Line number="8">But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.</Line>
<Line number="9">It is not only the old who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right.</Line>
<Line number="10">"Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.</Line>
<Line number="11">I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,</Line>
<Line number="12">I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.</Line>
<Line number="13">Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man.'</Line>
<Line number="14">But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.</Line>
<Line number="15">"They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.</Line>
<Line number="16">Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?</Line>
<Line number="17">I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.</Line>
<Line number="18">For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;</Line>
<Line number="19">inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.</Line>
<Line number="20">I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.</Line>
<Line number="21">I will show partiality to no one, nor will I flatter any man;</Line>
<Line number="22">for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="33">
<Line number="1">"But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.</Line>
<Line number="2">I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.</Line>
<Line number="3">My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.</Line>
<Line number="4">The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</Line>
<Line number="5">Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me.</Line>
<Line number="6">I am just like you before God; I too have been taken from clay.</Line>
<Line number="7">No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you.</Line>
<Line number="8">"But you have said in my hearing--I heard the very words--</Line>
<Line number="9">'I am pure and without sin; I am clean and free from guilt.</Line>
<Line number="10">Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.</Line>
<Line number="11">He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.'</Line>
<Line number="12">"But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.</Line>
<Line number="13">Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words?</Line>
<Line number="14">For God does speak--now one way, now another--though man may not perceive it.</Line>
<Line number="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,</Line>
<Line number="16">he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,</Line>
<Line number="17">to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,</Line>
<Line number="18">to preserve his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.</Line>
<Line number="19">Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones,</Line>
<Line number="20">so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.</Line>
<Line number="21">His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.</Line>
<Line number="22">His soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the messengers of death.</Line>
<Line number="23">"Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,</Line>
<Line number="24">to be gracious to him and say, 'Spare him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for him'--</Line>
<Line number="25">then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth.</Line>
<Line number="26">He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state.</Line>
<Line number="27">Then he comes to men and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.</Line>
<Line number="28">He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.'</Line>
<Line number="29">"God does all these things to a man--twice, even three times--</Line>
<Line number="30">to turn back his soul from the pit, that the light of life may shine on him.</Line>
<Line number="31">"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.</Line>
<Line number="32">If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared.</Line>
<Line number="33">But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="34">
<Line number="1">Then Elihu said:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning.</Line>
<Line number="3">For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.</Line>
<Line number="4">Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.</Line>
<Line number="5">"Job says, 'I am innocent, but God denies me justice.</Line>
<Line number="6">Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.'</Line>
<Line number="7">What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?</Line>
<Line number="8">He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men.</Line>
<Line number="9">For he says, 'It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.'</Line>
<Line number="10">"So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.</Line>
<Line number="11">He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.</Line>
<Line number="12">It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.</Line>
<Line number="13">Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?</Line>
<Line number="14">If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath,</Line>
<Line number="15">all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust.</Line>
<Line number="16">"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.</Line>
<Line number="17">Can he who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?</Line>
<Line number="18">Is he not the One who says to kings, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked,'</Line>
<Line number="19">who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?</Line>
<Line number="20">They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.</Line>
<Line number="21">"His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.</Line>
<Line number="22">There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.</Line>
<Line number="23">God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.</Line>
<Line number="24">Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.</Line>
<Line number="25">Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.</Line>
<Line number="26">He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,</Line>
<Line number="27">because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.</Line>
<Line number="28">They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.</Line>
<Line number="29">But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,</Line>
<Line number="30">to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people.</Line>
<Line number="31">"Suppose a man says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more.</Line>
<Line number="32">Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'</Line>
<Line number="33">Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.</Line>
<Line number="34">"Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,</Line>
<Line number="35">'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'</Line>
<Line number="36">Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!</Line>
<Line number="37">To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="35">
<Line number="1">Then Elihu said:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Do you think this is just? You say, 'I will be cleared by God.'</Line>
<Line number="3">Yet you ask him, 'What profit is it to me, and what do I gain by not sinning?'</Line>
<Line number="4">"I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.</Line>
<Line number="5">Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.</Line>
<Line number="6">If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?</Line>
<Line number="7">If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?</Line>
<Line number="8">Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men.</Line>
<Line number="9">"Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.</Line>
<Line number="10">But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,</Line>
<Line number="11">who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?'</Line>
<Line number="12">He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.</Line>
<Line number="13">Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.</Line>
<Line number="14">How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,</Line>
<Line number="15">and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.</Line>
<Line number="16">So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="36">
<Line number="1">Elihu continued:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf.</Line>
<Line number="3">I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker.</Line>
<Line number="4">Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you.</Line>
<Line number="5">"God is mighty, but does not despise men; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.</Line>
<Line number="6">He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.</Line>
<Line number="7">He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.</Line>
<Line number="8">But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,</Line>
<Line number="9">he tells them what they have done--that they have sinned arrogantly.</Line>
<Line number="10">He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.</Line>
<Line number="11">If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.</Line>
<Line number="12">But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.</Line>
<Line number="13">"The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.</Line>
<Line number="14">They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines.</Line>
<Line number="15">But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction.</Line>
<Line number="16">"He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.</Line>
<Line number="17">But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you.</Line>
<Line number="18">Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.</Line>
<Line number="19">Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?</Line>
<Line number="20">Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes.</Line>
<Line number="21">Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction.</Line>
<Line number="22">"God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?</Line>
<Line number="23">Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, 'You have done wrong'?</Line>
<Line number="24">Remember to extol his work, which men have praised in song.</Line>
<Line number="25">All mankind has seen it; men gaze on it from afar.</Line>
<Line number="26">How great is God--beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out.</Line>
<Line number="27">"He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams;</Line>
<Line number="28">the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.</Line>
<Line number="29">Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?</Line>
<Line number="30">See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea.</Line>
<Line number="31">This is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance.</Line>
<Line number="32">He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.</Line>
<Line number="33">His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="37">
<Line number="1">"At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.</Line>
<Line number="2">Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.</Line>
<Line number="3">He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.</Line>
<Line number="4">After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back.</Line>
<Line number="5">God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.</Line>
<Line number="6">He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, 'Be a mighty downpour.'</Line>
<Line number="7">So that all men he has made may know his work, he stops every man from his labor.</Line>
<Line number="8">The animals take cover; they remain in their dens.</Line>
<Line number="9">The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds.</Line>
<Line number="10">The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen.</Line>
<Line number="11">He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.</Line>
<Line number="12">At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.</Line>
<Line number="13">He brings the clouds to punish men, or to water his earth and show his love.</Line>
<Line number="14">"Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God's wonders.</Line>
<Line number="15">Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?</Line>
<Line number="16">Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge?</Line>
<Line number="17">You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind,</Line>
<Line number="18">can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?</Line>
<Line number="19">"Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.</Line>
<Line number="20">Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?</Line>
<Line number="21">Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.</Line>
<Line number="22">Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.</Line>
<Line number="23">The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.</Line>
<Line number="24">Therefore, men revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?"</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="38">
<Line number="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm. He said:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Who is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge?</Line>
<Line number="3">Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.</Line>
<Line number="4">"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand.</Line>
<Line number="5">Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?</Line>
<Line number="6">On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone--</Line>
<Line number="7">while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?</Line>
<Line number="8">"Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,</Line>
<Line number="9">when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,</Line>
<Line number="10">when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,</Line>
<Line number="11">when I said, 'This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt'?</Line>
<Line number="12">"Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place,</Line>
<Line number="13">that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?</Line>
<Line number="14">The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.</Line>
<Line number="15">The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken.</Line>
<Line number="16">"Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?</Line>
<Line number="17">Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?</Line>
<Line number="18">Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this.</Line>
<Line number="19">"What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?</Line>
<Line number="20">Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?</Line>
<Line number="21">Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years!</Line>
<Line number="22">"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,</Line>
<Line number="23">which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?</Line>
<Line number="24">What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?</Line>
<Line number="25">Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,</Line>
<Line number="26">to water a land where no man lives, a desert with no one in it,</Line>
<Line number="27">to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?</Line>
<Line number="28">Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?</Line>
<Line number="29">From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens</Line>
<Line number="30">when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?</Line>
<Line number="31">"Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades? Can you loose the cords of Orion?</Line>
<Line number="32">Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs?</Line>
<Line number="33">Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God'sdominion over the earth?</Line>
<Line number="34">"Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?</Line>
<Line number="35">Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, 'Here we are'?</Line>
<Line number="36">Who endowed the heart with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind?</Line>
<Line number="37">Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens</Line>
<Line number="38">when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together?</Line>
<Line number="39">"Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions</Line>
<Line number="40">when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?</Line>
<Line number="41">Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="39">
<Line number="1">"Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn?</Line>
<Line number="2">Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth?</Line>
<Line number="3">They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended.</Line>
<Line number="4">Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return.</Line>
<Line number="5">"Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied his ropes?</Line>
<Line number="6">I gave him the wasteland as his home, the salt flats as his habitat.</Line>
<Line number="7">He laughs at the commotion in the town; he does not hear a driver's shout.</Line>
<Line number="8">He ranges the hills for his pasture and searches for any green thing.</Line>
<Line number="9">"Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?</Line>
<Line number="10">Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he till the valleys behind you?</Line>
<Line number="11">Will you rely on him for his great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to him?</Line>
<Line number="12">Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?</Line>
<Line number="13">"The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but they cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork.</Line>
<Line number="14">She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand,</Line>
<Line number="15">unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them.</Line>
<Line number="16">She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain,</Line>
<Line number="17">for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense.</Line>
<Line number="18">Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider.</Line>
<Line number="19">"Do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane?</Line>
<Line number="20">Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?</Line>
<Line number="21">He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his strength, and charges into the fray.</Line>
<Line number="22">He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; he does not shy away from the sword.</Line>
<Line number="23">The quiver rattles against his side, along with the flashing spear and lance.</Line>
<Line number="24">In frenzied excitement he eats up the ground; he cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.</Line>
<Line number="25">At the blast of the trumpet he snorts, 'Aha!' He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry.</Line>
<Line number="26">"Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread his wings toward the south?</Line>
<Line number="27">Does the eagle soar at your command and build his nest on high?</Line>
<Line number="28">He dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is his stronghold.</Line>
<Line number="29">From there he seeks out his food; his eyes detect it from afar.</Line>
<Line number="30">His young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there is he."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="40">
<Line number="1">The LORD said to Job:</Line>
<Line number="2">"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"</Line>
<Line number="3">Then Job answered the LORD:</Line>
<Line number="4">"I am unworthy--how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.</Line>
<Line number="5">I spoke once, but I have no answer--twice, but I will say no more."</Line>
<Line number="6">Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:</Line>
<Line number="7">"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.</Line>
<Line number="8">"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?</Line>
<Line number="9">Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?</Line>
<Line number="10">Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.</Line>
<Line number="11">Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,</Line>
<Line number="12">look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.</Line>
<Line number="13">Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.</Line>
<Line number="14">Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.</Line>
<Line number="15">"Look at the behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.</Line>
<Line number="16">What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!</Line>
<Line number="17">His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.</Line>
<Line number="18">His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.</Line>
<Line number="19">He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.</Line>
<Line number="20">The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.</Line>
<Line number="21">Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.</Line>
<Line number="22">The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.</Line>
<Line number="23">When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.</Line>
<Line number="24">Can anyone capture him by the eyes, or trap him and pierce his nose?</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="41">
<Line number="1">"Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?</Line>
<Line number="2">Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?</Line>
<Line number="3">Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?</Line>
<Line number="4">Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?</Line>
<Line number="5">Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?</Line>
<Line number="6">Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?</Line>
<Line number="7">Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?</Line>
<Line number="8">If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!</Line>
<Line number="9">Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.</Line>
<Line number="10">No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?</Line>
<Line number="11">Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.</Line>
<Line number="12">"I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.</Line>
<Line number="13">Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?</Line>
<Line number="14">Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?</Line>
<Line number="15">His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;</Line>
<Line number="16">each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.</Line>
<Line number="17">They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.</Line>
<Line number="18">His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.</Line>
<Line number="19">Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.</Line>
<Line number="20">Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.</Line>
<Line number="21">His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.</Line>
<Line number="22">Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.</Line>
<Line number="23">The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.</Line>
<Line number="24">His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.</Line>
<Line number="25">When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.</Line>
<Line number="26">The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.</Line>
<Line number="27">Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.</Line>
<Line number="28">Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him.</Line>
<Line number="29">A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.</Line>
<Line number="30">His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.</Line>
<Line number="31">He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.</Line>
<Line number="32">Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.</Line>
<Line number="33">Nothing on earth is his equal--a creature without fear.</Line>
<Line number="34">He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="42">
<Line number="1">Then Job replied to the LORD:</Line>
<Line number="2">"I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted.</Line>
<Line number="3">You asked,'Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.</Line>
<Line number="4">"You said,'Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.'</Line>
<Line number="5">My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.</Line>
<Line number="6">Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."</Line>
<Line number="7">After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.</Line>
<Line number="8">So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."</Line>
<Line number="9">So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.</Line>
<Line number="10">After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.</Line>
<Line number="11">All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.</Line>
<Line number="12">The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.</Line>
<Line number="13">And he also had seven sons and three daughters.</Line>
<Line number="14">The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.</Line>
<Line number="15">Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</Line>
<Line number="16">After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.</Line>
<Line number="17">And so he died, old and full of years.</Line>
