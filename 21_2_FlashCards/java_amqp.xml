			<Title>What are the messaging model suported by AMQP?</Title>
			<Answer>
				<Line number="1">1. Direct Exchange --  It matches the p-2-p messaging model in JMS. However an important difference between JMS and AMQP is that with the AMQP direct exchange you can bind multiple direct queues to the exchange (meaning it is possible for more than one consumer to receive the message).  http://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-0.26/java-broker/Set/images/Exchange-Direct.png</Line>
				<Line number="2">2. Fanout exchange --  It is essentially the same as the p-2-s messaging model in JMS, without the use of message selector</Line>
				<Line number="3">3. Topic Exchange</Line>
				<Line number="4">4. Headers Exchange</Line>
				<Line number="5">5. System Exchange (not available in the QPID)</Line>
