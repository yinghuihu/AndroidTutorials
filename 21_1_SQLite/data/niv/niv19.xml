<Book number="19" name="诗篇" englishName="Psalms" chapters="150">
<Chapter number="1">
<Line number="1">Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.</Line>
<Line number="2">But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.</Line>
<Line number="3">He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.</Line>
<Line number="4">Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.</Line>
<Line number="5">Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.</Line>
<Line number="6">For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="2">
<Line number="1">Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?</Line>
<Line number="2">The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against his Anointed One.</Line>
<Line number="3">"Let us break their chains," they say, "and throw off their fetters."</Line>
<Line number="4">The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them.</Line>
<Line number="5">Then he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,</Line>
<Line number="6">"I have installed my King on Zion, my holy hill."</Line>
<Line number="7">I will proclaim the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father.</Line>
<Line number="8">Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.</Line>
<Line number="9">You will rule them with an iron scepter; you will dash them to pieces like pottery."</Line>
<Line number="10">Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.</Line>
<Line number="11">Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling.</Line>
<Line number="12">Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="3">
<Line number="1">O LORD, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me!</Line>
<Line number="2">Many are saying of me, "God will not deliver him." Selah</Line>
<Line number="3">But you are a shield around me, O LORD; you bestow glory on me and lift up my head.</Line>
<Line number="4">To the LORD I cry aloud, and he answers me from his holy hill. Selah</Line>
<Line number="5">I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the LORD sustains me.</Line>
<Line number="6">I will not fear the tens of thousands drawn up against me on every side.</Line>
<Line number="7">Arise, O LORD! Deliver me, O my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.</Line>
<Line number="8">From the LORD comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people. Selah</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="4">
<Line number="1">Answer me when I call to you, O my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress; be merciful to me and hear my prayer.</Line>
<Line number="2">How long, O men, will you turn my glory into shame? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods? Selah</Line>
<Line number="3">Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for himself; the LORD will hear when I call to him.</Line>
<Line number="4">In your anger do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent. Selah</Line>
<Line number="5">Offer right sacrifices and trust in the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="6">Many are asking, "Who can show us any good?" Let the light of your face shine upon us, O LORD.</Line>
<Line number="7">You have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and new wine abound.</Line>
<Line number="8">I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="5">
<Line number="1">Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my sighing.</Line>
<Line number="2">Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.</Line>
<Line number="3">In the morning, O LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation.</Line>
<Line number="4">You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; with you the wicked cannot dwell.</Line>
<Line number="5">The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong.</Line>
<Line number="6">You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the LORD abhors.</Line>
<Line number="7">But I, by your great mercy, will come into your house; in reverence will I bow down toward your holy temple.</Line>
<Line number="8">Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies--make straight your way before me.</Line>
<Line number="9">Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with destruction. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they speak deceit.</Line>
<Line number="10">Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.</Line>
<Line number="11">But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.</Line>
<Line number="12">For surely, O LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="6">
<Line number="1">O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.</Line>
<Line number="2">Be merciful to me, LORD, for I am faint; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are in agony.</Line>
<Line number="3">My soul is in anguish. How long, O LORD, how long?</Line>
<Line number="4">Turn, O LORD, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.</Line>
<Line number="5">No one remembers you when he is dead. Who praises you from the grave?</Line>
<Line number="6">I am worn out from groaning; all night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.</Line>
<Line number="7">My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.</Line>
<Line number="8">Away from me, all you who do evil, for the LORD has heard my weeping.</Line>
<Line number="9">The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer.</Line>
<Line number="10">All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed; they will turn back in sudden disgrace.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="7">
<Line number="1">O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me,</Line>
<Line number="2">or they will tear me like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.</Line>
<Line number="3">O LORD my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands--</Line>
<Line number="4">if I have done evil to him who is at peace with me or without cause have robbed my foe--</Line>
<Line number="5">then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust. Selah</Line>
<Line number="6">Arise, O LORD, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice.</Line>
<Line number="7">Let the assembled peoples gather around you. Rule over them from on high;</Line>
<Line number="8">let the LORD judge the peoples. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High.</Line>
<Line number="9">O righteous God, who searches minds and hearts, bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure.</Line>
<Line number="10">My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.</Line>
<Line number="11">God is a righteous judge, a God who expresses his wrath every day.</Line>
<Line number="12">If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.</Line>
<Line number="13">He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.</Line>
<Line number="14">He who is pregnant with evil and conceives trouble gives birth to disillusionment.</Line>
<Line number="15">He who digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit he has made.</Line>
<Line number="16">The trouble he causes recoils on himself; his violence comes down on his own head.</Line>
<Line number="17">I will give thanks to the LORD because of his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="8">
<Line number="1">O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.</Line>
<Line number="2">From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise because of your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.</Line>
<Line number="3">When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,</Line>
<Line number="4">what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?</Line>
<Line number="5">You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.</Line>
<Line number="6">You made him ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet:</Line>
<Line number="7">all flocks and herds, and the beasts of the field,</Line>
<Line number="8">the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.</Line>
<Line number="9">O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="9">
<Line number="1">I will praise you, O LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonders.</Line>
<Line number="2">I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.</Line>
<Line number="3">My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you.</Line>
<Line number="4">For you have upheld my right and my cause; you have sat on your throne, judging righteously.</Line>
<Line number="5">You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.</Line>
<Line number="6">Endless ruin has overtaken the enemy, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished.</Line>
<Line number="7">The LORD reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment.</Line>
<Line number="8">He will judge the world in righteousness; he will govern the peoples with justice.</Line>
<Line number="9">The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.</Line>
<Line number="10">Those who know your name will trust in you, for you, LORD, have never forsaken those who seek you.</Line>
<Line number="11">Sing praises to the LORD, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done.</Line>
<Line number="12">For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.</Line>
<Line number="13">O LORD, see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,</Line>
<Line number="14">that I may declare your praises in the gates of the Daughter of Zion and there rejoice in your salvation.</Line>
<Line number="15">The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.</Line>
<Line number="16">The LORD is known by his justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. Higgaion. Selah</Line>
<Line number="17">The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.</Line>
<Line number="18">But the needy will not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the afflicted ever perish.</Line>
<Line number="19">Arise, O LORD, let not man triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence.</Line>
<Line number="20">Strike them with terror, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="10">
<Line number="1">Why, O LORD, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</Line>
<Line number="2">In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises.</Line>
<Line number="3">He boasts of the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="4">In his pride the wicked does not seek him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God.</Line>
<Line number="5">His ways are always prosperous; he is haughty and your laws are far from him; he sneers at all his enemies.</Line>
<Line number="6">He says to himself, "Nothing will shake me; I'll always be happy and never have trouble."</Line>
<Line number="7">His mouth is full of curses and lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue.</Line>
<Line number="8">He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush he murders the innocent, watching in secret for his victims.</Line>
<Line number="9">He lies in wait like a lion in cover; he lies in wait to catch the helpless; he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.</Line>
<Line number="10">His victims are crushed, they collapse; they fall under his strength.</Line>
<Line number="11">He says to himself, "God has forgotten; he covers his face and never sees."</Line>
<Line number="12">Arise, LORD! Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless.</Line>
<Line number="13">Why does the wicked man revile God? Why does he say to himself, "He won't call me to account"?</Line>
<Line number="14">But you, O God, do see trouble and grief; you consider it to take it in hand. The victim commits himself to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.</Line>
<Line number="15">Break the arm of the wicked and evil man; call him to account for his wickedness that would not be found out.</Line>
<Line number="16">The LORD is King for ever and ever; the nations will perish from his land.</Line>
<Line number="17">You hear, O LORD, the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,</Line>
<Line number="18">defending the fatherless and the oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="11">
<Line number="1">In the LORD I take refuge. How then can you say to me: "Flee like a bird to your mountain.</Line>
<Line number="2">For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.</Line>
<Line number="3">When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do?"</Line>
<Line number="4">The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD is on his heavenly throne. He observes the sons of men; his eyes examine them.</Line>
<Line number="5">The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked and those who love violence his soul hates.</Line>
<Line number="6">On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.</Line>
<Line number="7">For the LORD is righteous, he loves justice; upright men will see his face.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="12">
<Line number="1">Help, LORD, for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men.</Line>
<Line number="2">Everyone lies to his neighbor; their flattering lips speak with deception.</Line>
<Line number="3">May the LORD cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue</Line>
<Line number="4">that says, "We will triumph with our tongues; we own our lips--who is our master?"</Line>
<Line number="5">"Because of the oppression of the weak and the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says the LORD. "I will protect them from those who malign them."</Line>
<Line number="6">And the words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace of clay, purified seven times.</Line>
<Line number="7">O LORD, you will keep us safe and protect us from such people forever.</Line>
<Line number="8">The wicked freely strut about when what is vile is honored among men.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="13">
<Line number="1">How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?</Line>
<Line number="2">How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and every day have sorrow in my heart? How long will my enemy triumph over me?</Line>
<Line number="3">Look on me and answer, O LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death;</Line>
<Line number="4">my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," and my foes will rejoice when I fall.</Line>
<Line number="5">But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation.</Line>
<Line number="6">I will sing to the LORD, for he has been good to me.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="14">
<Line number="1">The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.</Line>
<Line number="2">The LORD looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.</Line>
<Line number="3">All have turned aside, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.</Line>
<Line number="4">Will evildoers never learn--those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on the LORD?</Line>
<Line number="5">There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous.</Line>
<Line number="6">You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge.</Line>
<Line number="7">Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="15">
<Line number="1">LORD, who may dwell in your sanctuary? Who may live on your holy hill?</Line>
<Line number="2">He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from his heart</Line>
<Line number="3">and has no slander on his tongue, who does his neighbor no wrong and casts no slur on his fellowman,</Line>
<Line number="4">who despises a vile man but honors those who fear the LORD, who keeps his oath even when it hurts,</Line>
<Line number="5">who lends his money without usury and does not accept a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="16">
<Line number="1">Keep me safe, O God, for in you I take refuge.</Line>
<Line number="2">I said to the LORD, "You are my Lord; apart from you I have no good thing."</Line>
<Line number="3">As for the saints who are in the land, they are the glorious ones in whom is all my delight.</Line>
<Line number="4">The sorrows of those will increase who run after other gods. I will not pour out their libations of blood or take up their names on my lips.</Line>
<Line number="5">LORD, you have assigned me my portion and my cup; you have made my lot secure.</Line>
<Line number="6">The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance.</Line>
<Line number="7">I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me.</Line>
<Line number="8">I have set the LORD always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.</Line>
<Line number="9">Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest secure,</Line>
<Line number="10">because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.</Line>
<Line number="11">You have made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="17">
<Line number="1">Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea; listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer--it does not rise from deceitful lips.</Line>
<Line number="2">May my vindication come from you; may your eyes see what is right.</Line>
<Line number="3">Though you probe my heart and examine me at night, though you test me, you will find nothing; I have resolved that my mouth will not sin.</Line>
<Line number="4">As for the deeds of men--by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.</Line>
<Line number="5">My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not slipped.</Line>
<Line number="6">I call on you, O God, for you will answer me; give ear to me and hear my prayer.</Line>
<Line number="7">Show the wonder of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes.</Line>
<Line number="8">Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings</Line>
<Line number="9">from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me.</Line>
<Line number="10">They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with arrogance.</Line>
<Line number="11">They have tracked me down, they now surround me, with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground.</Line>
<Line number="12">They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a great lion crouching in cover.</Line>
<Line number="13">Rise up, O LORD, confront them, bring them down; rescue me from the wicked by your sword.</Line>
<Line number="14">O LORD, by your hand save me from such men, from men of this world whose reward is in this life. You still the hunger of those you cherish; their sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.</Line>
<Line number="15">And I--in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="18">
<Line number="1">I love you, O LORD, my strength.</Line>
<Line number="2">The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge. He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.</Line>
<Line number="3">I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies.</Line>
<Line number="4">The cords of death entangled me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.</Line>
<Line number="5">The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.</Line>
<Line number="6">In my distress I called to the LORD; I cried to my God for help. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears.</Line>
<Line number="7">The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry.</Line>
<Line number="8">Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.</Line>
<Line number="9">He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.</Line>
<Line number="10">He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.</Line>
<Line number="11">He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him--the dark rain clouds of the sky.</Line>
<Line number="12">Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning.</Line>
<Line number="13">The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.</Line>
<Line number="14">He shot his arrows and scattered the enemies, great bolts of lightning and routed them.</Line>
<Line number="15">The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of breath from your nostrils.</Line>
<Line number="16">He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.</Line>
<Line number="17">He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me.</Line>
<Line number="18">They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support.</Line>
<Line number="19">He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.</Line>
<Line number="20">The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.</Line>
<Line number="21">For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God.</Line>
<Line number="22">All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.</Line>
<Line number="23">I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.</Line>
<Line number="24">The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.</Line>
<Line number="25">To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,</Line>
<Line number="26">to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.</Line>
<Line number="27">You save the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.</Line>
<Line number="28">You, O LORD, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light.</Line>
<Line number="29">With your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall.</Line>
<Line number="30">As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.</Line>
<Line number="31">For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?</Line>
<Line number="32">It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.</Line>
<Line number="33">He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights.</Line>
<Line number="34">He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</Line>
<Line number="35">You give me your shield of victory, and your right hand sustains me; you stoop down to make me great.</Line>
<Line number="36">You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn.</Line>
<Line number="37">I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.</Line>
<Line number="38">I crushed them so that they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.</Line>
<Line number="39">You armed me with strength for battle; you made my adversaries bow at my feet.</Line>
<Line number="40">You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.</Line>
<Line number="41">They cried for help, but there was no one to save them--to the LORD, but he did not answer.</Line>
<Line number="42">I beat them as fine as dust borne on the wind; I poured them out like mud in the streets.</Line>
<Line number="43">You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head of nations; people I did not know are subject to me.</Line>
<Line number="44">As soon as they hear me, they obey me; foreigners cringe before me.</Line>
<Line number="45">They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds.</Line>
<Line number="46">The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior!</Line>
<Line number="47">He is the God who avenges me, who subdues nations under me,</Line>
<Line number="48">who saves me from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from violent men you rescued me.</Line>
<Line number="49">Therefore I will praise you among the nations, O LORD; I will sing praises to your name.</Line>
<Line number="50">He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="19">
<Line number="1">The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.</Line>
<Line number="2">Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge.</Line>
<Line number="3">There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.</Line>
<Line number="4">Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun,</Line>
<Line number="5">which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.</Line>
<Line number="6">It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat.</Line>
<Line number="7">The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple.</Line>
<Line number="8">The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.</Line>
<Line number="9">The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the LORD are sure and altogether righteous.</Line>
<Line number="10">They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.</Line>
<Line number="11">By them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.</Line>
<Line number="12">Who can discern his errors? Forgive my hidden faults.</Line>
<Line number="13">Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression.</Line>
<Line number="14">May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="20">
<Line number="1">May the LORD answer you when you are in distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.</Line>
<Line number="2">May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.</Line>
<Line number="3">May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings. Selah</Line>
<Line number="4">May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.</Line>
<Line number="5">We will shout for joy when you are victorious and will lift up our banners in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your requests.</Line>
<Line number="6">Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed; he answers him from his holy heaven with the saving power of his right hand.</Line>
<Line number="7">Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.</Line>
<Line number="8">They are brought to their knees and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.</Line>
<Line number="9">O LORD, save the king! Answer us when we call!</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="21">
<Line number="1">O LORD, the king rejoices in your strength. How great is his joy in the victories you give!</Line>
<Line number="2">You have granted him the desire of his heart and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah</Line>
<Line number="3">You welcomed him with rich blessings and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.</Line>
<Line number="4">He asked you for life, and you gave it to him--length of days, for ever and ever.</Line>
<Line number="5">Through the victories you gave, his glory is great; you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.</Line>
<Line number="6">Surely you have granted him eternal blessings and made him glad with the joy of your presence.</Line>
<Line number="7">For the king trusts in the LORD; through the unfailing love of the Most High he will not be shaken.</Line>
<Line number="8">Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; your right hand will seize your foes.</Line>
<Line number="9">At the time of your appearing you will make them like a fiery furnace. In his wrath the LORD will swallow them up, and his fire will consume them.</Line>
<Line number="10">You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from mankind.</Line>
<Line number="11">Though they plot evil against you and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed;</Line>
<Line number="12">for you will make them turn their backs when you aim at them with drawn bow.</Line>
<Line number="13">Be exalted, O LORD, in your strength; we will sing and praise your might.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="22">
<Line number="1">My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from the words of my groaning?</Line>
<Line number="2">O my God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, and am not silent.</Line>
<Line number="3">Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the praise of Israel.</Line>
<Line number="4">In you our fathers put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them.</Line>
<Line number="5">They cried to you and were saved; in you they trusted and were not disappointed.</Line>
<Line number="6">But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people.</Line>
<Line number="7">All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads:</Line>
<Line number="8">"He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him."</Line>
<Line number="9">Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast.</Line>
<Line number="10">From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother's womb you have been my God.</Line>
<Line number="11">Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.</Line>
<Line number="12">Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.</Line>
<Line number="13">Roaring lions tearing their prey open their mouths wide against me.</Line>
<Line number="14">I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me.</Line>
<Line number="15">My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.</Line>
<Line number="16">Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet.</Line>
<Line number="17">I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me.</Line>
<Line number="18">They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.</Line>
<Line number="19">But you, O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me.</Line>
<Line number="20">Deliver my life from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs.</Line>
<Line number="21">Rescue me from the mouth of the lions; save me from the horns of the wild oxen.</Line>
<Line number="22">I will declare your name to my brothers; in the congregation I will praise you.</Line>
<Line number="23">You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!</Line>
<Line number="24">For he has not despised or disdained the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help.</Line>
<Line number="25">From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; before those who fear you will I fulfill my vows.</Line>
<Line number="26">The poor will eat and be satisfied; they who seek the LORD will praise him--may your hearts live forever!</Line>
<Line number="27">All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him,</Line>
<Line number="28">for dominion belongs to the LORD and he rules over the nations.</Line>
<Line number="29">All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before him--those who cannot keep themselves alive.</Line>
<Line number="30">Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord.</Line>
<Line number="31">They will proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn--for he has done it.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="23">
<Line number="1">The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.</Line>
<Line number="2">He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,</Line>
<Line number="3">he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</Line>
<Line number="4">Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.</Line>
<Line number="5">You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.</Line>
<Line number="6">Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="24">
<Line number="1">The earth is the LORD'S, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;</Line>
<Line number="2">for he founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.</Line>
<Line number="3">Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place?</Line>
<Line number="4">He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear by what is false.</Line>
<Line number="5">He will receive blessing from the LORD and vindication from God his Savior.</Line>
<Line number="6">Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, O God of Jacob. Selah</Line>
<Line number="7">Lift up your heads, O you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.</Line>
<Line number="8">Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.</Line>
<Line number="9">Lift up your heads, O you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.</Line>
<Line number="10">Who is he, this King of glory? The LORD Almighty--he is the King of glory. Selah</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="25">
<Line number="1">To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul;</Line>
<Line number="2">in you I trust, O my God. Do not let me be put to shame, nor let my enemies triumph over me.</Line>
<Line number="3">No one whose hope is in you will ever be put to shame, but they will be put to shame who are treacherous without excuse.</Line>
<Line number="4">Show me your ways, O LORD, teach me your paths;</Line>
<Line number="5">guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long.</Line>
<Line number="6">Remember, O LORD, your great mercy and love, for they are from of old.</Line>
<Line number="7">Remember not the sins of my youth and my rebellious ways; according to your love remember me, for you are good, O LORD.</Line>
<Line number="8">Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.</Line>
<Line number="9">He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.</Line>
<Line number="10">All the ways of the LORD are loving and faithful for those who keep the demands of his covenant.</Line>
<Line number="11">For the sake of your name, O LORD, forgive my iniquity, though it is great.</Line>
<Line number="12">Who, then, is the man that fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the way chosen for him.</Line>
<Line number="13">He will spend his days in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land.</Line>
<Line number="14">The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them.</Line>
<Line number="15">My eyes are ever on the LORD, for only he will release my feet from the snare.</Line>
<Line number="16">Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.</Line>
<Line number="17">The troubles of my heart have multiplied; free me from my anguish.</Line>
<Line number="18">Look upon my affliction and my distress and take away all my sins.</Line>
<Line number="19">See how my enemies have increased and how fiercely they hate me!</Line>
<Line number="20">Guard my life and rescue me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.</Line>
<Line number="21">May integrity and uprightness protect me, because my hope is in you.</Line>
<Line number="22">Redeem Israel, O God, from all their troubles!</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="26">
<Line number="1">Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have led a blameless life; I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.</Line>
<Line number="2">Test me, O LORD, and try me, examine my heart and my mind;</Line>
<Line number="3">for your love is ever before me, and I walk continually in your truth.</Line>
<Line number="4">I do not sit with deceitful men, nor do I consort with hypocrites;</Line>
<Line number="5">I abhor the assembly of evildoers and refuse to sit with the wicked.</Line>
<Line number="6">I wash my hands in innocence, and go about your altar, O LORD,</Line>
<Line number="7">proclaiming aloud your praise and telling of all your wonderful deeds.</Line>
<Line number="8">I love the house where you live, O LORD, the place where your glory dwells.</Line>
<Line number="9">Do not take away my soul along with sinners, my life with bloodthirsty men,</Line>
<Line number="10">in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes.</Line>
<Line number="11">But I lead a blameless life; redeem me and be merciful to me.</Line>
<Line number="12">My feet stand on level ground; in the great assembly I will praise the LORD.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="27">
<Line number="1">The LORD is my light and my salvation--whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life--of whom shall I be afraid?</Line>
<Line number="2">When evil men advance against me to devour my flesh, when my enemies and my foes attack me, they will stumble and fall.</Line>
<Line number="3">Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then will I be confident.</Line>
<Line number="4">One thing I ask of the LORD, this is what I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple.</Line>
<Line number="5">For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in the shelter of his tabernacle and set me high upon a rock.</Line>
<Line number="6">Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his tabernacle will I sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="7">Hear my voice when I call, O LORD; be merciful to me and answer me.</Line>
<Line number="8">My heart says of you, "Seek his face!" Your face, LORD, I will seek.</Line>
<Line number="9">Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, O God my Savior.</Line>
<Line number="10">Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me.</Line>
<Line number="11">Teach me your way, O LORD; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors.</Line>
<Line number="12">Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.</Line>
<Line number="13">I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.</Line>
<Line number="14">Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="28">
<Line number="1">To you I call, O LORD my Rock; do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent, I will be like those who have gone down to the pit.</Line>
<Line number="2">Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.</Line>
<Line number="3">Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts.</Line>
<Line number="4">Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back upon them what they deserve.</Line>
<Line number="5">Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again.</Line>
<Line number="6">Praise be to the LORD, for he has heard my cry for mercy.</Line>
<Line number="7">The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song.</Line>
<Line number="8">The LORD is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.</Line>
<Line number="9">Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever.</Line>

<Line number="3">The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the LORD thunders over the mighty waters.</Line>
<Line number="4">The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is majestic.</Line>
<Line number="5">The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.</Line>
<Line number="6">He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox.</Line>
<Line number="7">The voice of the LORD strikes with flashes of lightning.</Line>
<Line number="8">The voice of the LORD shakes the desert; the LORD shakes the Desert of Kadesh.</Line>
<Line number="9">The voice of the LORD twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in his temple all cry, "Glory!"</Line>
<Line number="10">The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD is enthroned as King forever.</Line>
<Line number="11">The LORD gives strength to his people; the LORD blesses his people with peace.</Line>

<Chapter number="30">
<Line number="1">I will exalt you, O LORD, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.</Line>
<Line number="2">O LORD my God, I called to you for help and you healed me.</Line>
<Line number="3">O LORD, you brought me up from the grave; you spared me from going down into the pit.</Line>
<Line number="4">Sing to the LORD, you saints of his; praise his holy name.</Line>
<Line number="5">For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.</Line>
<Line number="6">When I felt secure, I said, "I will never be shaken."</Line>
<Line number="7">O LORD, when you favored me, you made my mountain stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed.</Line>
<Line number="8">To you, O LORD, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy:</Line>
<Line number="9">"What gain is there in my destruction, in my going down into the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness?</Line>
<Line number="10">Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me; O LORD, be my help."</Line>
<Line number="11">You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,</Line>
<Line number="12">that my heart may sing to you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give you thanks forever.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="31">
<Line number="1">In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame; deliver me in your righteousness.</Line>
<Line number="2">Turn your ear to me, come quickly to my rescue; be my rock of refuge, a strong fortress to save me.</Line>
<Line number="3">Since you are my rock and my fortress, for the sake of your name lead and guide me.</Line>
<Line number="4">Free me from the trap that is set for me, for you are my refuge.</Line>
<Line number="5">Into your hands I commit my spirit; redeem me, O LORD, the God of truth.</Line>
<Line number="6">I hate those who cling to worthless idols; I trust in the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="7">I will be glad and rejoice in your love, for you saw my affliction and knew the anguish of my soul.</Line>
<Line number="8">You have not handed me over to the enemy but have set my feet in a spacious place.</Line>
<Line number="9">Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; my eyes grow weak with sorrow, my soul and my body with grief.</Line>
<Line number="10">My life is consumed by anguish and my years by groaning; my strength fails because of my affliction, and my bones grow weak.</Line>
<Line number="11">Because of all my enemies, I am the utter contempt of my neighbors; I am a dread to my friends--those who see me on the street flee from me.</Line>
<Line number="12">I am forgotten by them as though I were dead; I have become like broken pottery.</Line>
<Line number="13">For I hear the slander of many; there is terror on every side; they conspire against me and plot to take my life.</Line>
<Line number="14">But I trust in you, O LORD; I say, "You are my God."</Line>
<Line number="15">My times are in your hands; deliver me from my enemies and from those who pursue me.</Line>
<Line number="16">Let your face shine on your servant; save me in your unfailing love.</Line>
<Line number="17">Let me not be put to shame, O LORD, for I have cried out to you; but let the wicked be put to shame and lie silent in the grave.</Line>
<Line number="18">Let their lying lips be silenced, for with pride and contempt they speak arrogantly against the righteous.</Line>
<Line number="19">How great is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you, which you bestow in the sight of men on those who take refuge in you.</Line>
<Line number="20">In the shelter of your presence you hide them from the intrigues of men; in your dwelling you keep them safe from accusing tongues.</Line>
<Line number="21">Praise be to the LORD, for he showed his wonderful love to me when I was in a besieged city.</Line>
<Line number="22">In my alarm I said, "I am cut off from your sight!" Yet you heard my cry for mercy when I called to you for help.</Line>
<Line number="23">Love the LORD, all his saints! The LORD preserves the faithful, but the proud he pays back in full.</Line>
<Line number="24">Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the LORD.</Line>

<Chapter number="32">
<Line number="1">Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.</Line>
<Line number="2">Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit.</Line>
<Line number="3">When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.</Line>
<Line number="4">For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Selah</Line>
<Line number="5">Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD"--and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah</Line>
<Line number="6">Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him.</Line>
<Line number="7">You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah</Line>
<Line number="8">I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you.</Line>
<Line number="9">Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you.</Line>
<Line number="10">Many are the woes of the wicked, but the LORD'S unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in him.</Line>
<Line number="11">Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart!</Line>

<Chapter number="33">
<Line number="1">Sing joyfully to the LORD, you righteous; it is fitting for the upright to praise him.</Line>
<Line number="2">Praise the LORD with the harp; make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.</Line>
<Line number="3">Sing to him a new song; play skillfully, and shout for joy.</Line>
<Line number="4">For the word of the LORD is right and true; he is faithful in all he does.</Line>
<Line number="5">The LORD loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love.</Line>
<Line number="6">By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.</Line>
<Line number="7">He gathers the waters of the sea into jars; he puts the deep into storehouses.</Line>
<Line number="8">Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the people of the world revere him.</Line>
<Line number="9">For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.</Line>
<Line number="10">The LORD foils the plans of the nations; he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.</Line>
<Line number="11">But the plans of the LORD stand firm forever, the purposes of his heart through all generations.</Line>
<Line number="12">Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people he chose for his inheritance.</Line>
<Line number="13">From heaven the LORD looks down and sees all mankind;</Line>
<Line number="14">from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earth--</Line>
<Line number="15">he who forms the hearts of all, who considers everything they do.</Line>
<Line number="16">No king is saved by the size of his army; no warrior escapes by his great strength.</Line>
<Line number="17">A horse is a vain hope for deliverance; despite all its great strength it cannot save.</Line>
<Line number="18">But the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear him, on those whose hope is in his unfailing love,</Line>
<Line number="19">to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.</Line>
<Line number="20">We wait in hope for the LORD; he is our help and our shield.</Line>
<Line number="21">In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name.</Line>
<Line number="22">May your unfailing love rest upon us, O LORD, even as we put our hope in you.</Line>

<Chapter number="34">
<Line number="1">I will extol the LORD at all times; his praise will always be on my lips.</Line>
<Line number="2">My soul will boast in the LORD; let the afflicted hear and rejoice.</Line>

<Line number="4">I sought the LORD, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears.</Line>
<Line number="5">Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.</Line>
<Line number="6">This poor man called, and the LORD heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles.</Line>
<Line number="7">The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers them.</Line>
<Line number="8">Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.</Line>
<Line number="9">Fear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him lack nothing.</Line>

<Line number="16">the face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.</Line>
<Line number="17">The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles.</Line>
<Line number="18">The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.</Line>
<Line number="19">A righteous man may have many troubles, but the LORD delivers him from them all;</Line>
<Line number="20">he protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken.</Line>
<Line number="21">Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the righteous will be condemned.</Line>

<Line number="3">Brandish spear and javelin against those who pursue me. Say to my soul, "I am your salvation."</Line>
<Line number="4">May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.</Line>
<Line number="5">May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away;</Line>

<Line number="11">Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about.</Line>
<Line number="12">They repay me evil for good and leave my soul forlorn.</Line>
<Line number="13">Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered,</Line>
<Line number="14">I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.</Line>
<Line number="15">But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; attackers gathered against me when I was unaware. They slandered me without ceasing.</Line>
<Line number="16">Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked; they gnashed their teeth at me.</Line>
<Line number="17">O Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue my life from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.</Line>
<Line number="18">I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among throngs of people I will praise you.</Line>
<Line number="19">Let not those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; let not those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye.</Line>
<Line number="20">They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land.</Line>
<Line number="21">They gape at me and say, "Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it."</Line>
<Line number="22">O LORD, you have seen this; be not silent. Do not be far from me, O Lord.</Line>
<Line number="23">Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord.</Line>
<Line number="24">Vindicate me in your righteousness, O LORD my God; do not let them gloat over me.</Line>
<Line number="25">Do not let them think, "Aha, just what we wanted!" or say, "We have swallowed him up."</Line>
<Line number="26">May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.</Line>
<Line number="27">May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, "The LORD be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant."</Line>

</Chapter>
<Chapter number="36">
<Line number="1">An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before his eyes.</Line>
<Line number="2">For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin.</Line>
<Line number="3">The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and to do good.</Line>
<Line number="4">Even on his bed he plots evil; he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong.</Line>
<Line number="5">Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.</Line>
<Line number="6">Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the great deep. O LORD, you preserve both man and beast.</Line>
<Line number="7">How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find refuge in the shadow of your wings.</Line>

<Chapter number="37">
<Line number="1">Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong;</Line>
<Line number="2">for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away.</Line>
<Line number="3">Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.</Line>
<Line number="4">Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart.</Line>
<Line number="5">Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this:</Line>
<Line number="6">He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.</Line>
<Line number="7">Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.</Line>
<Line number="8">Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret--it leads only to evil.</Line>
<Line number="9">For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land.</Line>
<Line number="10">A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.</Line>
<Line number="11">But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace.</Line>
<Line number="12">The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them;</Line>
<Line number="13">but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.</Line>
<Line number="14">The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.</Line>
<Line number="15">But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.</Line>
<Line number="16">Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked;</Line>
<Line number="17">for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.</Line>
<Line number="18">The days of the blameless are known to the LORD, and their inheritance will endure forever.</Line>
<Line number="19">In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.</Line>
<Line number="20">But the wicked will perish: The LORD'S enemies will be like the beauty of the fields, they will vanish--vanish like smoke.</Line>
<Line number="21">The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously;</Line>
<Line number="22">those the LORD blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be cut off.</Line>
<Line number="23">If the LORD delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm;</Line>
<Line number="24">though he stumble, he will not fall, for the LORD upholds him with his hand.</Line>
<Line number="25">I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.</Line>
<Line number="26">They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be blessed.</Line>
<Line number="27">Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever.</Line>
<Line number="28">For the LORD loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. They will be protected forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off;</Line>
<Line number="29">the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.</Line>
<Line number="30">The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just.</Line>
<Line number="31">The law of his God is in his heart; his feet do not slip.</Line>
<Line number="32">The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, seeking their very lives;</Line>
<Line number="33">but the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when brought to trial.</Line>
<Line number="34">Wait for the LORD and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.</Line>
<Line number="35">I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil,</Line>
<Line number="36">but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found.</Line>
<Line number="37">Consider the blameless, observe the upright; there is a future for the man of peace.</Line>
<Line number="38">But all sinners will be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off.</Line>
<Line number="39">The salvation of the righteous comes from the LORD; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.</Line>
<Line number="40">The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="38">
<Line number="1">O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.</Line>
<Line number="2">For your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down upon me.</Line>
<Line number="3">Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; my bones have no soundness because of my sin.</Line>
<Line number="4">My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear.</Line>
<Line number="5">My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly.</Line>
<Line number="6">I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning.</Line>
<Line number="7">My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body.</Line>
<Line number="8">I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.</Line>
<Line number="9">All my longings lie open before you, O Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.</Line>
<Line number="10">My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.</Line>
<Line number="11">My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.</Line>
<Line number="12">Those who seek my life set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they plot deception.</Line>
<Line number="13">I am like a deaf man, who cannot hear, like a mute, who cannot open his mouth;</Line>
<Line number="14">I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.</Line>
<Line number="15">I wait for you, O LORD; you will answer, O Lord my God.</Line>
<Line number="16">For I said, "Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."</Line>
<Line number="17">For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.</Line>
<Line number="18">I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.</Line>
<Line number="19">Many are those who are my vigorous enemies; those who hate me without reason are numerous.</Line>
<Line number="20">Those who repay my good with evil slander me when I pursue what is good.</Line>
<Line number="21">O LORD, do not forsake me; be not far from me, O my God.</Line>
<Line number="22">Come quickly to help me, O Lord my Savior.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="39">
<Line number="1">I said, "I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked are in my presence."</Line>
<Line number="2">But when I was silent and still, not even saying anything good, my anguish increased.</Line>
<Line number="3">My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:</Line>
<Line number="4">"Show me, O LORD, my life's end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting is my life.</Line>
<Line number="5">You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Each man's life is but a breath. Selah</Line>
<Line number="6">Man is a mere phantom as he goes to and fro: He bustles about, but only in vain; he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will get it.</Line>
<Line number="7">"But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.</Line>
<Line number="8">Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.</Line>
<Line number="9">I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.</Line>
<Line number="10">Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.</Line>
<Line number="11">You rebuke and discipline men for their sin; you consume their wealth like a moth--each man is but a breath. Selah</Line>
<Line number="12">"Hear my prayer, O LORD, listen to my cry for help; be not deaf to my weeping. For I dwell with you as an alien, a stranger, as all my fathers were.</Line>
<Line number="13">Look away from me, that I may rejoice again before I depart and am no more."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="40">
<Line number="1">I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry.</Line>
<Line number="2">He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.</Line>
<Line number="3">He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="4">Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods.</Line>
<Line number="5">Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. The things you planned for us no one can recount to you; were I to speak and tell of them, they would be too many to declare.</Line>
<Line number="6">Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.</Line>
<Line number="7">Then I said, "Here I am, I have come--it is written about me in the scroll.</Line>
<Line number="8">I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart."</Line>
<Line number="9">I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, as you know, O LORD.</Line>
<Line number="10">I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and salvation. I do not conceal your love and your truth from the great assembly.</Line>
<Line number="11">Do not withhold your mercy from me, O LORD; may your love and your truth always protect me.</Line>
<Line number="12">For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me.</Line>
<Line number="13">Be pleased, O LORD, to save me; O LORD, come quickly to help me.</Line>
<Line number="14">May all who seek to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.</Line>
<Line number="15">May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!" be appalled at their own shame.</Line>
<Line number="16">But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation always say, "The LORD be exalted!"</Line>
<Line number="17">Yet I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my God, do not delay.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="41">
<Line number="1">Blessed is he who has regard for the weak; the LORD delivers him in times of trouble.</Line>
<Line number="2">The LORD will protect him and preserve his life; he will bless him in the land and not surrender him to the desire of his foes.</Line>
<Line number="3">The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed and restore him from his bed of illness.</Line>
<Line number="4">I said, "O LORD, have mercy on me; heal me, for I have sinned against you."</Line>
<Line number="5">My enemies say of me in malice, "When will he die and his name perish?"</Line>
<Line number="6">Whenever one comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander; then he goes out and spreads it abroad.</Line>
<Line number="7">All my enemies whisper together against me; they imagine the worst for me, saying,</Line>
<Line number="8">"A vile disease has beset him; he will never get up from the place where he lies."</Line>
<Line number="9">Even my close friend, whom I trusted, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.</Line>
<Line number="10">But you, O LORD, have mercy on me; raise me up, that I may repay them.</Line>
<Line number="11">I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.</Line>

<Line number="4">These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng.</Line>
<Line number="5">Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and</Line>
<Line number="6">my God. My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon--from Mount Mizar.</Line>
<Line number="7">Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.</Line>
<Line number="8">By day the LORD directs his love, at night his song is with me--a prayer to the God of my life.</Line>
<Line number="9">I say to God my Rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?"</Line>
<Line number="10">My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, "Where is your God?"</Line>

<Line number="3">Send forth your light and your truth, let them guide me; let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell.</Line>
<Line number="4">Then will I go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight. I will praise you with the harp, O God, my God.</Line>

<Line number="1">We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.</Line>
<Line number="2">With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our fathers; you crushed the peoples and made our fathers flourish.</Line>
<Line number="3">It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them.</Line>
<Line number="4">You are my King and my God, who decrees victories for Jacob.</Line>
<Line number="5">Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.</Line>
<Line number="6">I do not trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;</Line>

<Line number="8">In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever. Selah</Line>
<Line number="9">But now you have rejected and humbled us; you no longer go out with our armies.</Line>
<Line number="10">You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us.</Line>
<Line number="11">You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.</Line>
<Line number="12">You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale.</Line>
<Line number="13">You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.</Line>
<Line number="14">You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.</Line>
<Line number="15">My disgrace is before me all day long, and my face is covered with shame</Line>
<Line number="16">at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.</Line>
<Line number="17">All this happened to us, though we had not forgotten you or been false to your covenant.</Line>
<Line number="18">Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.</Line>
<Line number="19">But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals and covered us over with deep darkness.</Line>
<Line number="20">If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,</Line>
<Line number="21">would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?</Line>
<Line number="22">Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.</Line>
<Line number="23">Awake, O Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.</Line>
<Line number="24">Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?</Line>

<Line number="13">Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you.</Line>
<Line number="14">Save me from bloodguilt, O God, the God who saves me, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.</Line>
<Line number="15">O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.</Line>
<Line number="16">You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.</Line>
<Line number="17">The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.</Line>
<Line number="18">In your good pleasure make Zion prosper; build up the walls of Jerusalem.</Line>
<Line number="19">Then there will be righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings to delight you; then bulls will be offered on your altar.</Line>

<Chapter number="52">
<Line number="1">" Why do you boast of evil, you mighty man? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?</Line>
<Line number="2">Your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor, you who practice deceit.</Line>
<Line number="3">You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth. Selah</Line>
<Line number="4">You love every harmful word, O you deceitful tongue!</Line>
<Line number="5">Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah</Line>
<Line number="6">The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at him, saying,</Line>
<Line number="7">"Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!"</Line>
<Line number="8">But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God's unfailing love for ever and ever.</Line>
<Line number="9">I will praise you forever for what you have done; in your name I will hope, for your name is good. I will praise you in the presence of your saints.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="53">
<Line number="1">The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.</Line>
<Line number="2">God looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.</Line>
<Line number="3">Everyone has turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.</Line>
<Line number="4">Will the evildoers never learn--those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on God?</Line>
<Line number="5">There they were, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them.</Line>
<Line number="6">Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!</Line>

<Line number="9">Confuse the wicked, O Lord, confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city.</Line>
<Line number="10">Day and night they prowl about on its walls; malice and abuse are within it.</Line>
<Line number="11">Destructive forces are at work in the city; threats and lies never leave its streets.</Line>
<Line number="12">If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were raising himself against me, I could hide from him.</Line>
<Line number="13">But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend,</Line>
<Line number="14">with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship as we walked with the throng at the house of God.</Line>
<Line number="15">Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them go down alive to the grave, for evil finds lodging among them.</Line>
<Line number="16">But I call to God, and the LORD saves me.</Line>
<Line number="17">Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.</Line>
<Line number="18">He ransoms me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.</Line>
<Line number="19">God, who is enthroned forever, will hear them and afflict them--Selah men who never change their ways and have no fear of God.</Line>
<Line number="20">My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.</Line>
<Line number="21">His speech is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords.</Line>
<Line number="22">Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous fall.</Line>
<Line number="23">But you, O God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of corruption; bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live out half their days. But as for me, I trust in you.</Line>

<Chapter number="56">
<Line number="1">Be merciful to me, O God, for men hotly pursue me; all day long they press their attack.</Line>

<Line number="1">Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge uprightly among men?</Line>
<Line number="2">No, in your heart you devise injustice, and your hands mete out violence on the earth.</Line>
<Line number="3">Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward and speak lies.</Line>
<Line number="4">Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,</Line>

<Line number="6">Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; tear out, O LORD, the fangs of the lions!</Line>

<Line number="20">Scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none.</Line>
<Line number="21">They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.</Line>
<Line number="22">May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution and a trap.</Line>

<Line number="25">May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.</Line>
<Line number="26">For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt.</Line>
<Line number="27">Charge them with crime upon crime; do not let them share in your salvation.</Line>
<Line number="28">May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.</Line>
<Line number="29">I am in pain and distress; may your salvation, O God, protect me.</Line>
<Line number="30">I will praise God's name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.</Line>
<Line number="31">This will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hoofs.</Line>
<Line number="32">The poor will see and be glad--you who seek God, may your hearts live!</Line>
<Line number="33">The LORD hears the needy and does not despise his captive people.</Line>
<Line number="34">Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them,</Line>

<Line number="1">Hasten, O God, to save me; O LORD, come quickly to help me.</Line>

<Line number="3">Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.</Line>

<Line number="5">For you have been my hope, O Sovereign LORD, my confidence since my youth.</Line>
<Line number="6">From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother's womb. I will ever praise you.</Line>
<Line number="7">I have become like a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge.</Line>
<Line number="8">My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long.</Line>
<Line number="9">Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.</Line>

<Line number="17">Since my youth, O God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.</Line>
<Line number="18">Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come.</Line>
<Line number="19">Your righteousness reaches to the skies, O God, you who have done great things. Who, O God, is like you?</Line>
<Line number="20">Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.</Line>
<Line number="21">You will increase my honor and comfort me once again.</Line>
<Line number="22">I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praise to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.</Line>
<Line number="23">My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you--I, whom you have redeemed.</Line>

<Line number="1">Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness.</Line>
<Line number="2">He will judge your people in righteousness, your afflicted ones with justice.</Line>

<Chapter number="73">
<Line number="1">Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.</Line>
<Line number="2">But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.</Line>
<Line number="3">For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</Line>
<Line number="4">They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong.</Line>
<Line number="5">They are free from the burdens common to man; they are not plagued by human ills.</Line>
<Line number="6">Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.</Line>
<Line number="7">From their callous hearts comes iniquity; the evil conceits of their minds know no limits.</Line>
<Line number="8">They scoff, and speak with malice; in their arrogance they threaten oppression.</Line>
<Line number="9">Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.</Line>
<Line number="10">Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.</Line>
<Line number="11">They say, "How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?"</Line>
<Line number="12">This is what the wicked are like--always carefree, they increase in wealth.</Line>
<Line number="13">Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure; in vain have I washed my hands in innocence.</Line>
<Line number="14">All day long I have been plagued; I have been punished every morning.</Line>
<Line number="15">If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed your children.</Line>
<Line number="16">When I tried to understand all this, it was oppressive to me</Line>
<Line number="17">till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.</Line>
<Line number="18">Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.</Line>
<Line number="19">How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!</Line>
<Line number="20">As a dream when one awakes, so when you arise, O Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.</Line>
<Line number="21">When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered,</Line>
<Line number="22">I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you.</Line>
<Line number="23">Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.</Line>
<Line number="24">You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.</Line>
<Line number="25">Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.</Line>
<Line number="26">My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</Line>
<Line number="27">Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.</Line>
<Line number="28">But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign LORD my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="74">
<Line number="1">Why have you rejected us forever, O God? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</Line>
<Line number="2">Remember the people you purchased of old, the tribe of your inheritance, whom you redeemed--Mount Zion, where you dwelt.</Line>
<Line number="3">Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.</Line>
<Line number="4">Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs.</Line>
<Line number="5">They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.</Line>
<Line number="6">They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.</Line>
<Line number="7">They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.</Line>
<Line number="8">They said in their hearts, "We will crush them completely!" They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.</Line>
<Line number="9">We are given no miraculous signs; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be.</Line>
<Line number="10">How long will the enemy mock you, O God? Will the foe revile your name forever?</Line>
<Line number="11">Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!</Line>
<Line number="12">But you, O God, are my king from of old; you bring salvation upon the earth.</Line>
<Line number="13">It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.</Line>
<Line number="14">It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.</Line>
<Line number="15">It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever flowing rivers.</Line>
<Line number="16">The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.</Line>
<Line number="17">It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.</Line>
<Line number="18">Remember how the enemy has mocked you, O LORD, how foolish people have reviled your name.</Line>
<Line number="19">Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.</Line>
<Line number="20">Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.</Line>
<Line number="21">Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name.</Line>
<Line number="22">Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long.</Line>
<Line number="23">Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="75">
<Line number="1">We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks, for your Name is near; men tell of your wonderful deeds.</Line>
<Line number="2">You say, "I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge uprightly.</Line>
<Line number="3">When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm. Selah</Line>
<Line number="4">To the arrogant I say, 'Boast no more,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horns.</Line>
<Line number="5">Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak with outstretched neck.'"</Line>
<Line number="6">No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt a man.</Line>
<Line number="7">But it is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.</Line>
<Line number="8">In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.</Line>
<Line number="9">As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.</Line>
<Line number="10">I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.</Line>

<Chapter number="76">
<Line number="1">In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel.</Line>
<Line number="2">His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.</Line>
<Line number="3">There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war. Selah</Line>
<Line number="4">You are resplendent with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game.</Line>
<Line number="5">Valiant men lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands.</Line>
<Line number="6">At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still.</Line>
<Line number="7">You alone are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?</Line>
<Line number="8">From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quiet--</Line>
<Line number="9">when you, O God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land. Selah</Line>
<Line number="10">Surely your wrath against men brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.</Line>
<Line number="11">Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared.</Line>
<Line number="12">He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="77">
<Line number="1">I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me.</Line>
<Line number="2">When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands and my soul refused to be comforted.</Line>
<Line number="3">I remembered you, O God, and I groaned; I mused, and my spirit grew faint. Selah</Line>
<Line number="4">You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.</Line>
<Line number="5">I thought about the former days, the years of long ago;</Line>
<Line number="6">I remembered my songs in the night. My heart mused and my spirit inquired:</Line>
<Line number="7">"Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?</Line>
<Line number="8">Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?</Line>
<Line number="9">Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?" Selah</Line>
<Line number="10">Then I thought, "To this I will appeal: the years of the right hand of the Most High."</Line>
<Line number="11">I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.</Line>
<Line number="12">I will meditate on all your works and consider all your mighty deeds.</Line>
<Line number="13">Your ways, O God, are holy. What god is so great as our God?</Line>
<Line number="14">You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.</Line>
<Line number="15">With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah</Line>
<Line number="16">The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.</Line>
<Line number="17">The clouds poured down water, the skies resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.</Line>
<Line number="18">Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.</Line>
<Line number="19">Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen.</Line>
<Line number="20">You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="78">
<Line number="1">O my people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.</Line>
<Line number="2">I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old--</Line>
<Line number="3">what we have heard and known, what our fathers have told us.</Line>
<Line number="4">We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.</Line>
<Line number="5">He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,</Line>
<Line number="6">so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.</Line>
<Line number="7">Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.</Line>
<Line number="8">They would not be like their forefathers--a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.</Line>
<Line number="9">The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;</Line>
<Line number="10">they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law.</Line>
<Line number="11">They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.</Line>
<Line number="12">He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.</Line>
<Line number="13">He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall.</Line>
<Line number="14">He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.</Line>
<Line number="15">He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;</Line>
<Line number="16">he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.</Line>
<Line number="17">But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.</Line>
<Line number="18">They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.</Line>
<Line number="19">They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the desert?</Line>
<Line number="20">When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?"</Line>
<Line number="21">When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,</Line>
<Line number="22">for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.</Line>
<Line number="23">Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;</Line>
<Line number="24">he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.</Line>
<Line number="25">Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.</Line>
<Line number="26">He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power.</Line>
<Line number="27">He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore.</Line>
<Line number="28">He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.</Line>
<Line number="29">They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved.</Line>
<Line number="30">But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths,</Line>
<Line number="31">God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.</Line>
<Line number="32">In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.</Line>
<Line number="33">So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.</Line>
<Line number="34">Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.</Line>
<Line number="35">They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.</Line>
<Line number="36">But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;</Line>
<Line number="37">their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.</Line>
<Line number="38">Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.</Line>
<Line number="39">He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.</Line>
<Line number="40">How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!</Line>
<Line number="41">Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</Line>
<Line number="42">They did not remember his power--the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</Line>
<Line number="43">the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.</Line>
<Line number="44">He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.</Line>
<Line number="45">He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.</Line>
<Line number="46">He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.</Line>
<Line number="47">He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</Line>
<Line number="48">He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.</Line>
<Line number="49">He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility--a band of destroying angels.</Line>
<Line number="50">He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.</Line>
<Line number="51">He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</Line>
<Line number="52">But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.</Line>
<Line number="53">He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.</Line>
<Line number="54">Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.</Line>
<Line number="55">He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.</Line>
<Line number="56">But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.</Line>
<Line number="57">Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.</Line>
<Line number="58">They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</Line>
<Line number="59">When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.</Line>
<Line number="60">He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.</Line>
<Line number="61">He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</Line>
<Line number="62">He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.</Line>
<Line number="63">Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;</Line>
<Line number="64">their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.</Line>
<Line number="65">Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.</Line>
<Line number="66">He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.</Line>
<Line number="67">Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;</Line>
<Line number="68">but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.</Line>
<Line number="69">He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.</Line>
<Line number="70">He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;</Line>
<Line number="71">from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.</Line>
<Line number="72">And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.</Line>

<Chapter number="79">
<Line number="1">O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.</Line>

<Line number="3">They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.</Line>
<Line number="4">We are objects of reproach to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us.</Line>
<Line number="5">How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?</Line>
<Line number="6">Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name;</Line>
<Line number="7">for they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his homeland.</Line>
<Line number="8">Do not hold against us the sins of the fathers; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need.</Line>

<Line number="4">this is a decree for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.</Line>
<Line number="5">He established it as a statute for Joseph when he went out against Egypt, where we heard a language we did not understand.</Line>
<Line number="6">He says, "I removed the burden from their shoulders; their hands were set free from the basket.</Line>
<Line number="7">In your distress you called and I rescued you, I answered you out of a thundercloud; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah</Line>
<Line number="8">"Hear, O my people, and I will warn you--if you would but listen to me, O Israel!</Line>
<Line number="9">You shall have no foreign god among you; you shall not bow down to an alien god.</Line>
<Line number="10">I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.</Line>
<Line number="11">"But my people would not listen to me; Israel would not submit to me.</Line>
<Line number="12">So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices.</Line>
<Line number="13">"If my people would but listen to me, if Israel would follow my ways,</Line>
<Line number="14">how quickly would I subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes!</Line>
<Line number="15">Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.</Line>
<Line number="16">But you would be fed with the finest of wheat; with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."</Line>

<Line number="1">God presides in the great assembly; he gives judgment among the "gods":</Line>

<Line number="6">Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel was among those who called on his name; they called on the LORD and he answered them.</Line>
<Line number="7">He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept his statutes and the decrees he gave them.</Line>
<Line number="8">O LORD our God, you answered them; you were to Israel a forgiving God, though you punished their misdeeds.</Line>

<Chapter number="101">
<Line number="1">I will sing of your love and justice; to you, O LORD, I will sing praise.</Line>
<Line number="2">I will be careful to lead a blameless life--when will you come to me? I will walk in my house with blameless heart.</Line>
<Line number="3">I will set before my eyes no vile thing. The deeds of faithless men I hate; they will not cling to me.</Line>
<Line number="4">Men of perverse heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with evil.</Line>

<Line number="7">No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence.</Line>

</Chapter>
<Chapter number="102">
<Line number="1">Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come to you.</Line>
<Line number="2">Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly.</Line>
<Line number="3">For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers.</Line>
<Line number="4">My heart is blighted and withered like grass; I forget to eat my food.</Line>
<Line number="5">Because of my loud groaning I am reduced to skin and bones.</Line>
<Line number="6">I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.</Line>
<Line number="7">I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof.</Line>
<Line number="8">All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse.</Line>
<Line number="9">For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears</Line>
<Line number="10">because of your great wrath, for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.</Line>
<Line number="11">My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass.</Line>
<Line number="12">But you, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.</Line>
<Line number="13">You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.</Line>
<Line number="14">For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity.</Line>
<Line number="15">The nations will fear the name of the LORD, all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.</Line>
<Line number="16">For the LORD will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.</Line>
<Line number="17">He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.</Line>
<Line number="18">Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the LORD:</Line>
<Line number="19">"The LORD looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth,</Line>
<Line number="20">to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death."</Line>
<Line number="21">So the name of the LORD will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem</Line>
<Line number="22">when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="23">In the course of my life he broke my strength; he cut short my days.</Line>
<Line number="24">So I said: "Do not take me away, O my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations.</Line>
<Line number="25">In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</Line>
<Line number="26">They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded.</Line>
<Line number="27">But you remain the same, and your years will never end.</Line>
<Line number="28">The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="103">
<Line number="1">Praise the LORD, O my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name.</Line>
<Line number="2">Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits--</Line>
<Line number="3">who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,</Line>
<Line number="4">who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,</Line>
<Line number="5">who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.</Line>
<Line number="6">The LORD works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.</Line>
<Line number="7">He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel:</Line>
<Line number="8">The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.</Line>
<Line number="9">He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;</Line>
<Line number="10">he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.</Line>
<Line number="11">For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him;</Line>
<Line number="12">as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</Line>
<Line number="13">As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him;</Line>
<Line number="14">for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.</Line>
<Line number="15">As for man, his days are like grass, he flourishes like a flower of the field;</Line>
<Line number="16">the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.</Line>
<Line number="17">But from everlasting to everlasting the LORD'S love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children's children--</Line>
<Line number="18">with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.</Line>
<Line number="19">The LORD has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.</Line>
<Line number="20">Praise the LORD, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.</Line>
<Line number="21">Praise the LORD, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.</Line>
<Line number="22">Praise the LORD, all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the LORD, O my soul.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="104">
<Line number="1">Praise the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.</Line>
<Line number="2">He wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent</Line>
<Line number="3">and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.</Line>
<Line number="4">He makes winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants.</Line>
<Line number="5">He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.</Line>
<Line number="6">You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.</Line>
<Line number="7">But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;</Line>
<Line number="8">they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.</Line>
<Line number="9">You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth.</Line>
<Line number="10">He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains.</Line>
<Line number="11">They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.</Line>
<Line number="12">The birds of the air nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.</Line>
<Line number="13">He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of his work.</Line>
<Line number="14">He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for man to cultivate--bringing forth food from the earth:</Line>
<Line number="15">wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread that sustains his heart.</Line>
<Line number="16">The trees of the LORD are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.</Line>
<Line number="17">There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the pine trees.</Line>
<Line number="18">The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the coneys.</Line>
<Line number="19">The moon marks off the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down.</Line>
<Line number="20">You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl.</Line>
<Line number="21">The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.</Line>
<Line number="22">The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens.</Line>
<Line number="23">Then man goes out to his work, to his labor until evening.</Line>
<Line number="24">How many are your works, O LORD! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.</Line>
<Line number="25">There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number--living things both large and small.</Line>
<Line number="26">There the ships go to and fro, and the leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.</Line>
<Line number="27">These all look to you to give them their food at the proper time.</Line>
<Line number="28">When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.</Line>
<Line number="29">When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.</Line>
<Line number="30">When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth.</Line>
<Line number="31">May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works--</Line>
<Line number="32">he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.</Line>
<Line number="33">I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.</Line>
<Line number="34">May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="35">But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="105">
<Line number="1">Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done.</Line>
<Line number="2">Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.</Line>
<Line number="3">Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.</Line>
<Line number="4">Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.</Line>
<Line number="5">Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,</Line>
<Line number="6">O descendants of Abraham his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.</Line>
<Line number="7">He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</Line>
<Line number="8">He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,</Line>
<Line number="9">the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.</Line>
<Line number="10">He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:</Line>
<Line number="11">"To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit."</Line>
<Line number="12">When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,</Line>
<Line number="13">they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.</Line>
<Line number="14">He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:</Line>
<Line number="15">"Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."</Line>
<Line number="16">He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;</Line>
<Line number="17">and he sent a man before them--Joseph, sold as a slave.</Line>
<Line number="18">They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,</Line>
<Line number="19">till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true.</Line>
<Line number="20">The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.</Line>
<Line number="21">He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,</Line>
<Line number="22">to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.</Line>
<Line number="23">Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.</Line>
<Line number="24">The LORD made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes,</Line>
<Line number="25">whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.</Line>
<Line number="26">He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</Line>
<Line number="27">They performed his miraculous signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.</Line>
<Line number="28">He sent darkness and made the land dark--for had they not rebelled against his words?</Line>
<Line number="29">He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.</Line>
<Line number="30">Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.</Line>
<Line number="31">He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</Line>
<Line number="32">He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;</Line>
<Line number="33">he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.</Line>
<Line number="34">He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number;</Line>
<Line number="35">they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.</Line>
<Line number="36">Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.</Line>
<Line number="37">He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.</Line>
<Line number="38">Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.</Line>
<Line number="39">He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.</Line>
<Line number="40">They asked, and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</Line>
<Line number="41">He opened the rock, and water gushed out; like a river it flowed in the desert.</Line>
<Line number="42">For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham.</Line>
<Line number="43">He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;</Line>
<Line number="44">he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for--</Line>
<Line number="45">that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws. Praise the LORD.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="106">
<Line number="1">Praise the LORD. Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</Line>
<Line number="2">Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise?</Line>
<Line number="3">Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right.</Line>
<Line number="4">Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them,</Line>
<Line number="5">that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.</Line>
<Line number="6">We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.</Line>
<Line number="7">When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.</Line>
<Line number="8">Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known.</Line>
<Line number="9">He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.</Line>
<Line number="10">He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.</Line>
<Line number="11">The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.</Line>
<Line number="12">Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.</Line>
<Line number="13">But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel.</Line>
<Line number="14">In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test.</Line>
<Line number="15">So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them.</Line>
<Line number="16">In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="17">The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.</Line>
<Line number="18">Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.</Line>
<Line number="19">At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.</Line>
<Line number="20">They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass.</Line>
<Line number="21">They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,</Line>
<Line number="22">miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.</Line>
<Line number="23">So he said he would destroy them--had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.</Line>
<Line number="24">Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.</Line>
<Line number="25">They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="26">So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert,</Line>
<Line number="27">make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.</Line>
<Line number="28">They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;</Line>
<Line number="29">they provoked the LORD to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.</Line>
<Line number="30">But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.</Line>
<Line number="31">This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.</Line>
<Line number="32">By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them;</Line>
<Line number="33">for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips.</Line>
<Line number="34">They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,</Line>
<Line number="35">but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.</Line>
<Line number="36">They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.</Line>
<Line number="37">They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</Line>
<Line number="38">They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.</Line>
<Line number="39">They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.</Line>
<Line number="40">Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.</Line>
<Line number="41">He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them.</Line>
<Line number="42">Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.</Line>
<Line number="43">Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.</Line>
<Line number="44">But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;</Line>
<Line number="45">for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.</Line>
<Line number="46">He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive.</Line>
<Line number="47">Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.</Line>
<Line number="48">Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="107">
<Line number="1">Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</Line>
<Line number="2">Let the redeemed of the LORD say this--those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,</Line>
<Line number="3">those he gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.</Line>
<Line number="4">Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle.</Line>
<Line number="5">They were hungry and thirsty, and their lives ebbed away.</Line>
<Line number="6">Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</Line>
<Line number="7">He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle.</Line>
<Line number="8">Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men,</Line>
<Line number="9">for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.</Line>
<Line number="10">Some sat in darkness and the deepest gloom, prisoners suffering in iron chains,</Line>
<Line number="11">for they had rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.</Line>
<Line number="12">So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.</Line>
<Line number="13">Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.</Line>
<Line number="14">He brought them out of darkness and the deepest gloom and broke away their chains.</Line>
<Line number="15">Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men,</Line>
<Line number="16">for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron.</Line>
<Line number="17">Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities.</Line>
<Line number="18">They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death.</Line>
<Line number="19">Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.</Line>
<Line number="20">He sent forth his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave.</Line>
<Line number="21">Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.</Line>
<Line number="22">Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy.</Line>
<Line number="23">Others went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters.</Line>
<Line number="24">They saw the works of the LORD, his wonderful deeds in the deep.</Line>
<Line number="25">For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.</Line>
<Line number="26">They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away.</Line>
<Line number="27">They reeled and staggered like drunken men; they were at their wits' end.</Line>
<Line number="28">Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.</Line>
<Line number="29">He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed.</Line>
<Line number="30">They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven.</Line>
<Line number="31">Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.</Line>
<Line number="32">Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders.</Line>
<Line number="33">He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground,</Line>
<Line number="34">and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there.</Line>
<Line number="35">He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs;</Line>
<Line number="36">there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle.</Line>
<Line number="37">They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest;</Line>
<Line number="38">he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish.</Line>
<Line number="39">Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity and sorrow;</Line>
<Line number="40">he who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste.</Line>
<Line number="41">But he lifted the needy out of their affliction and increased their families like flocks.</Line>
<Line number="42">The upright see and rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths.</Line>
<Line number="43">Whoever is wise, let him heed these things and consider the great love of the LORD.</Line>

<Line number="8">May his days be few; may another take his place of leadership.</Line>
<Line number="9">May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.</Line>
<Line number="10">May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes.</Line>
<Line number="11">May a creditor seize all he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.</Line>
<Line number="12">May no one extend kindness to him or take pity on his fatherless children.</Line>
<Line number="13">May his descendants be cut off, their names blotted out from the next generation.</Line>
<Line number="14">May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD; may the sin of his mother never be blotted out.</Line>
<Line number="15">May their sins always remain before the LORD, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</Line>
<Line number="16">For he never thought of doing a kindness, but hounded to death the poor and the needy and the brokenhearted.</Line>
<Line number="17">He loved to pronounce a curse--may it come on him; he found no pleasure in blessing--may it be far from him.</Line>
<Line number="18">He wore cursing as his garment; it entered into his body like water, into his bones like oil.</Line>
<Line number="19">May it be like a cloak wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.</Line>
<Line number="20">May this be the LORD'S payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil of me.</Line>
<Line number="21">But you, O Sovereign LORD, deal well with me for your name's sake; out of the goodness of your love, deliver me.</Line>
<Line number="22">For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</Line>
<Line number="23">I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.</Line>
<Line number="24">My knees give way from fasting; my body is thin and gaunt.</Line>
<Line number="25">I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.</Line>
<Line number="26">Help me, O LORD my God; save me in accordance with your love.</Line>
<Line number="27">Let them know that it is your hand, that you, O LORD, have done it.</Line>
<Line number="28">They may curse, but you will bless; when they attack they will be put to shame, but your servant will rejoice.</Line>
<Line number="29">My accusers will be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak.</Line>
<Line number="30">With my mouth I will greatly extol the LORD; in the great throng I will praise him.</Line>
<Line number="31">For he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save his life from those who condemn him.</Line>
