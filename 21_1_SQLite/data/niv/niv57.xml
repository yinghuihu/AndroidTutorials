		<Line number="1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,</Line>
		<Line number="2">to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home:</Line>
		<Line number="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</Line>
		<Line number="4">I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</Line>
		<Line number="5">because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</Line>
		<Line number="6">I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.</Line>
		<Line number="7">Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.</Line>
		<Line number="8">Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</Line>
		<Line number="9">yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--</Line>
		<Line number="10">I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.</Line>
		<Line number="11">Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</Line>
		<Line number="12">I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.</Line>
		<Line number="13">I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.</Line>
		<Line number="14">But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.</Line>
		<Line number="15">Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--</Line>
		<Line number="16">no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.</Line>
		<Line number="17">So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</Line>
		<Line number="18">If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.</Line>
		<Line number="19">I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.</Line>
		<Line number="20">I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</Line>
		<Line number="21">Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</Line>
		<Line number="22">And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.</Line>
		<Line number="23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.</Line>
		<Line number="24">And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.</Line>
		<Line number="25">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</Line>
