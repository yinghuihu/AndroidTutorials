<Chapter number="1">
<Line number="1">The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:</Line>
<Line number="2">for attaining wisdom and discipline; for understanding words of insight;</Line>
<Line number="3">for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life, doing what is right and just and fair;</Line>
<Line number="4">for giving prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young--</Line>
<Line number="5">let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance--</Line>
<Line number="6">for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.</Line>
<Line number="7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.</Line>
<Line number="8">Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.</Line>
<Line number="9">They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.</Line>
<Line number="10">My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in to them.</Line>
<Line number="11">If they say, "Come along with us; let's lie in wait for someone's blood, let's waylay some harmless soul;</Line>
<Line number="12">let's swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</Line>
<Line number="13">we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;</Line>
<Line number="14">throw in your lot with us, and we will share a common purse"--</Line>
<Line number="15">my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;</Line>
<Line number="16">for their feet rush into sin, they are swift to shed blood.</Line>
<Line number="17">How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds!</Line>
<Line number="18">These men lie in wait for their own blood; they waylay only themselves!</Line>
<Line number="19">Such is the end of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the lives of those who get it.</Line>
<Line number="20">Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares;</Line>
<Line number="21">at the head of the noisy streets she cries out, in the gateways of the city she makes her speech:</Line>
<Line number="22">"How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?</Line>
<Line number="23">If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you.</Line>
<Line number="24">But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand,</Line>
<Line number="25">since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke,</Line>
<Line number="26">I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you--</Line>
<Line number="27">when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you.</Line>
<Line number="28">"Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me.</Line>
<Line number="29">Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD,</Line>
<Line number="30">since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,</Line>
<Line number="31">they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.</Line>
<Line number="32">For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;</Line>
<Line number="33">but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="2">
<Line number="1">My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,</Line>
<Line number="2">turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding,</Line>
<Line number="3">and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding,</Line>
<Line number="4">and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,</Line>
<Line number="5">then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</Line>
<Line number="6">For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.</Line>
<Line number="7">He holds victory in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,</Line>
<Line number="8">for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.</Line>
<Line number="9">Then you will understand what is right and just and fair--every good path.</Line>
<Line number="10">For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</Line>
<Line number="11">Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.</Line>
<Line number="12">Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse,</Line>
<Line number="13">who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways,</Line>
<Line number="14">who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,</Line>
<Line number="15">whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.</Line>
<Line number="16">It will save you also from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words,</Line>
<Line number="17">who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.</Line>
<Line number="18">For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.</Line>
<Line number="19">None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.</Line>
<Line number="20">Thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous.</Line>
<Line number="21">For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;</Line>
<Line number="22">but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="3">
<Line number="1">My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart,</Line>
<Line number="2">for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity.</Line>
<Line number="3">Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.</Line>
<Line number="4">Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.</Line>
<Line number="5">Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;</Line>
<Line number="6">in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.</Line>
<Line number="7">Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil.</Line>
<Line number="8">This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.</Line>
<Line number="9">Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops;</Line>
<Line number="10">then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.</Line>
<Line number="11">My son, do not despise the LORD'S discipline and do not resent his rebuke,</Line>
<Line number="12">because the LORD disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in.</Line>
<Line number="13">Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gains understanding,</Line>
<Line number="14">for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold.</Line>
<Line number="15">She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.</Line>
<Line number="16">Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</Line>
<Line number="17">Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.</Line>
<Line number="18">She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who lay hold of her will be blessed.</Line>
<Line number="19">By wisdom the LORD laid the earth's foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place;</Line>
<Line number="20">by his knowledge the deeps were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.</Line>
<Line number="21">My son, preserve sound judgment and discernment, do not let them out of your sight;</Line>
<Line number="22">they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck.</Line>
<Line number="23">Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble;</Line>
<Line number="24">when you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</Line>
<Line number="25">Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,</Line>
<Line number="26">for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being snared.</Line>
<Line number="27">Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to act.</Line>
<Line number="28">Do not say to your neighbor, "Come back later; I'll give it tomorrow"--when you now have it with you.</Line>
<Line number="29">Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you.</Line>
<Line number="30">Do not accuse a man for no reason--when he has done you no harm.</Line>
<Line number="31">Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways,</Line>
<Line number="32">for the LORD detests a perverse man but takes the upright into his confidence.</Line>
<Line number="33">The LORD'S curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.</Line>
<Line number="34">He mocks proud mockers but gives grace to the humble.</Line>
<Line number="35">The wise inherit honor, but fools he holds up to shame.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="4">
<Line number="1">Listen, my sons, to a father's instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.</Line>
<Line number="2">I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching.</Line>
<Line number="3">When I was a boy in my father's house, still tender, and an only child of my mother,</Line>
<Line number="4">he taught me and said, "Lay hold of my words with all your heart; keep my commands and you will live.</Line>
<Line number="5">Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or swerve from them.</Line>
<Line number="6">Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.</Line>
<Line number="7">Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.</Line>
<Line number="8">Esteem her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you.</Line>
<Line number="9">She will set a garland of grace on your head and present you with a crown of splendor."</Line>
<Line number="10">Listen, my son, accept what I say, and the years of your life will be many.</Line>
<Line number="11">I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.</Line>
<Line number="12">When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; when you run, you will not stumble.</Line>
<Line number="13">Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life.</Line>
<Line number="14">Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evil men.</Line>
<Line number="15">Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way.</Line>
<Line number="16">For they cannot sleep till they do evil; they are robbed of slumber till they make someone fall.</Line>
<Line number="17">They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</Line>
<Line number="18">The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.</Line>
<Line number="19">But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.</Line>
<Line number="20">My son, pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words.</Line>
<Line number="21">Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;</Line>
<Line number="22">for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's whole body.</Line>
<Line number="23">Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.</Line>
<Line number="24">Put away perversity from your mouth; keep corrupt talk far from your lips.</Line>
<Line number="25">Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you.</Line>
<Line number="26">Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm.</Line>
<Line number="27">Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="5">
<Line number="1">My son, pay attention to my wisdom, listen well to my words of insight,</Line>
<Line number="2">that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.</Line>
<Line number="3">For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;</Line>
<Line number="4">but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.</Line>
<Line number="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.</Line>
<Line number="6">She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths are crooked, but she knows it not.</Line>
<Line number="7">Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say.</Line>
<Line number="8">Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,</Line>
<Line number="9">lest you give your best strength to others and your years to one who is cruel,</Line>
<Line number="10">lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich another man's house.</Line>
<Line number="11">At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.</Line>
<Line number="12">You will say, "How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction!</Line>
<Line number="13">I would not obey my teachers or listen to my instructors.</Line>
<Line number="14">I have come to the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly."</Line>
<Line number="15">Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.</Line>
<Line number="16">Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?</Line>
<Line number="17">Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.</Line>
<Line number="18">May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.</Line>
<Line number="19">A loving doe, a graceful deer--may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love.</Line>
<Line number="20">Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another man's wife?</Line>
<Line number="21">For a man's ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all his paths.</Line>
<Line number="22">The evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him; the cords of his sin hold him fast.</Line>
<Line number="23">He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="6">
<Line number="1">My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge for another,</Line>
<Line number="2">if you have been trapped by what you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth,</Line>
<Line number="3">then do this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor's hands: Go and humble yourself; press your plea with your neighbor!</Line>
<Line number="4">Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids.</Line>
<Line number="5">Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</Line>
<Line number="6">Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!</Line>
<Line number="7">It has no commander, no overseer or ruler,</Line>
<Line number="8">yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.</Line>
<Line number="9">How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep?</Line>
<Line number="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest--</Line>
<Line number="11">and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.</Line>
<Line number="12">A scoundrel and villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth,</Line>
<Line number="13">who winks with his eye, signals with his feet and motions with his fingers,</Line>
<Line number="14">who plots evil with deceit in his heart--he always stirs up dissension.</Line>
<Line number="15">Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed--without remedy.</Line>
<Line number="16">There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to him:</Line>
<Line number="17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</Line>
<Line number="18">a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil,</Line>
<Line number="19">a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers.</Line>
<Line number="20">My son, keep your father's commands and do not forsake your mother's teaching.</Line>
<Line number="21">Bind them upon your heart forever; fasten them around your neck.</Line>
<Line number="22">When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.</Line>
<Line number="23">For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the corrections of discipline are the way to life,</Line>
<Line number="24">keeping you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife.</Line>
<Line number="25">Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes,</Line>
<Line number="26">for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.</Line>
<Line number="27">Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?</Line>
<Line number="28">Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?</Line>
<Line number="29">So is he who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.</Line>
<Line number="30">Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.</Line>
<Line number="31">Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.</Line>
<Line number="32">But a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.</Line>
<Line number="33">Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away;</Line>
<Line number="34">for jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.</Line>
<Line number="35">He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse the bribe, however great it is.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="7">
<Line number="1">My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you.</Line>
<Line number="2">Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.</Line>
<Line number="3">Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.</Line>
<Line number="4">Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding your kinsman;</Line>
<Line number="5">they will keep you from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words.</Line>
<Line number="6">At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice.</Line>
<Line number="7">I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who lacked judgment.</Line>
<Line number="8">He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house</Line>
<Line number="9">at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in.</Line>
<Line number="10">Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.</Line>
<Line number="11">(She is loud and defiant, her feet never stay at home;</Line>
<Line number="12">now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.)</Line>
<Line number="13">She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said:</Line>
<Line number="14">"I have fellowship offerings at home; today I fulfilled my vows.</Line>
<Line number="15">So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you!</Line>
<Line number="16">I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt.</Line>
<Line number="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.</Line>
<Line number="18">Come, let's drink deep of love till morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love!</Line>
<Line number="19">My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.</Line>
<Line number="20">He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon."</Line>
<Line number="21">With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk.</Line>
<Line number="22">All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose</Line>
<Line number="23">till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.</Line>
<Line number="24">Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say.</Line>
<Line number="25">Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.</Line>
<Line number="26">Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng.</Line>
<Line number="27">Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="8">
<Line number="1">Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice?</Line>
<Line number="2">On the heights along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand;</Line>
<Line number="3">beside the gates leading into the city, at the entrances, she cries aloud:</Line>
<Line number="4">"To you, O men, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind.</Line>
<Line number="5">You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, gain understanding.</Line>
<Line number="6">Listen, for I have worthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is right.</Line>
<Line number="7">My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness.</Line>
<Line number="8">All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse.</Line>
<Line number="9">To the discerning all of them are right; they are faultless to those who have knowledge.</Line>
<Line number="10">Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold,</Line>
<Line number="11">for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</Line>
<Line number="12">"I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion.</Line>
<Line number="13">To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech.</Line>
<Line number="14">Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have understanding and power.</Line>
<Line number="15">By me kings reign and rulers make laws that are just;</Line>
<Line number="16">by me princes govern, and all nobles who rule on earth.</Line>
<Line number="17">I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me.</Line>
<Line number="18">With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity.</Line>
<Line number="19">My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver.</Line>
<Line number="20">I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,</Line>
<Line number="21">bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full.</Line>
<Line number="22">"The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old;</Line>
<Line number="23">I was appointed from eternity, from the beginning, before the world began.</Line>
<Line number="24">When there were no oceans, I was given birth, when there were no springs abounding with water;</Line>
<Line number="25">before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth,</Line>
<Line number="26">before he made the earth or its fields or any of the dust of the world.</Line>
<Line number="27">I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,</Line>
<Line number="28">when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,</Line>
<Line number="29">when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.</Line>
<Line number="30">Then I was the craftsman at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence,</Line>
<Line number="31">rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind.</Line>
<Line number="32">"Now then, my sons, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.</Line>
<Line number="33">Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not ignore it.</Line>
<Line number="34">Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway.</Line>
<Line number="35">For whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the LORD.</Line>
<Line number="36">But whoever fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death."</Line>
</Chapter>
<Chapter number="9">
<Line number="1">Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out its seven pillars.</Line>
<Line number="2">She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.</Line>
<Line number="3">She has sent out her maids, and she calls from the highest point of the city.</Line>
<Line number="4">"Let all who are simple come in here!" she says to those who lack judgment.</Line>
<Line number="5">"Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed.</Line>
<Line number="6">Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of understanding.</Line>
<Line number="7">"Whoever corrects a mocker invites insult; whoever rebukes a wicked man incurs abuse.</Line>
<Line number="8">Do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man and he will love you.</Line>
<Line number="9">Instruct a wise man and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man and he will add to his learning.</Line>
<Line number="10">"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</Line>
<Line number="11">For through me your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.</Line>
<Line number="12">If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you; if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer."</Line>
<Line number="13">The woman Folly is loud; she is undisciplined and without knowledge.</Line>
<Line number="14">She sits at the door of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city,</Line>
<Line number="15">calling out to those who pass by, who go straight on their way.</Line>
<Line number="16">"Let all who are simple come in here!" she says to those who lack judgment.</Line>
<Line number="17">"Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is delicious!"</Line>
<Line number="18">But little do they know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of the grave.</Line>

<Line number="5">remove the wicked from the king's presence, and his throne will be established through righteousness.</Line>
<Line number="6">Do not exalt yourself in the king's presence, and do not claim a place among great men;</Line>
<Line number="7">it is better for him to say to you, "Come up here," than for him to humiliate you before a nobleman. What you have seen with your eyes</Line>

<Line number="9">If you argue your case with a neighbor, do not betray another man's confidence,</Line>

<Line number="7">The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern.</Line>
<Line number="8">Mockers stir up a city, but wise men turn away anger.</Line>
<Line number="9">If a wise man goes to court with a fool, the fool rages and scoffs, and there is no peace.</Line>
<Line number="10">Bloodthirsty men hate a man of integrity and seek to kill the upright.</Line>
<Line number="11">A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control.</Line>
<Line number="12">If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked.</Line>
<Line number="13">The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: The LORD gives sight to the eyes of both.</Line>
<Line number="14">If a king judges the poor with fairness, his throne will always be secure.</Line>
<Line number="15">The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself disgraces his mother.</Line>
<Line number="16">When the wicked thrive, so does sin, but the righteous will see their downfall.</Line>
<Line number="17">Discipline your son, and he will give you peace; he will bring delight to your soul.</Line>
<Line number="18">Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; but blessed is he who keeps the law.</Line>
<Line number="19">A servant cannot be corrected by mere words; though he understands, he will not respond.</Line>
<Line number="20">Do you see a man who speaks in haste? There is more hope for a fool than for him.</Line>
<Line number="21">If a man pampers his servant from youth, he will bring grief in the end.</Line>
<Line number="22">An angry man stirs up dissension, and a hot-tempered one commits many sins.</Line>
<Line number="23">A man's pride brings him low, but a man of lowly spirit gains honor.</Line>
<Line number="24">The accomplice of a thief is his own enemy; he is put under oath and dare not testify.</Line>
<Line number="25">Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is kept safe.</Line>
<Line number="26">Many seek an audience with a ruler, but it is from the LORD that man gets justice.</Line>
<Line number="27">The righteous detest the dishonest; the wicked detest the upright.</Line>

<Line number="1">The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh--an oracle: This man declared to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ucal:</Line>
<Line number="2">"I am the most ignorant of men; I do not have a man's understanding.</Line>
<Line number="3">I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.</Line>
<Line number="4">Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Who has gathered up the wind in the hollow of his hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in his cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and the name of his son? Tell me if you know!</Line>
<Line number="5">"Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</Line>
<Line number="6">Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.</Line>
<Line number="7">"Two things I ask of you, O LORD; do not refuse me before I die:</Line>
<Line number="8">Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread.</Line>
<Line number="9">Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, 'Who is the LORD?' Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.</Line>
<Line number="10">"Do not slander a servant to his master, or he will curse you, and you will pay for it.</Line>
<Line number="11">"There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers;</Line>
<Line number="12">those who are pure in their own eyes and yet are not cleansed of their filth;</Line>
<Line number="13">those whose eyes are ever so haughty, whose glances are so disdainful;</Line>
<Line number="14">those whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are set with knives to devour the poor from the earth, the needy from among mankind.</Line>
<Line number="15">"The leech has two daughters. 'Give! Give!' they cry. "There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, 'Enough!':</Line>
<Line number="16">the grave, the barren womb, land, which is never satisfied with water, and fire, which never says, 'Enough!'</Line>
<Line number="17">"The eye that mocks a father, that scorns obedience to a mother, will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley, will be eaten by the vultures.</Line>
<Line number="18">"There are three things that are too amazing for me, four that I do not understand:</Line>
<Line number="19">the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a maiden.</Line>
<Line number="20">"This is the way of an adulteress: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, 'I've done nothing wrong.'</Line>
<Line number="21">"Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up:</Line>
<Line number="22">a servant who becomes king, a fool who is full of food,</Line>
<Line number="23">an unloved woman who is married, and a maidservant who displaces her mistress.</Line>
<Line number="24">"Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise:</Line>
<Line number="25">Ants are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer;</Line>
<Line number="26">coneys are creatures of little power, yet they make their home in the crags;</Line>
<Line number="27">locusts have no king, yet they advance together in ranks;</Line>
<Line number="28">a lizard can be caught with the hand, yet it is found in kings' palaces.</Line>
<Line number="29">"There are three things that are stately in their stride, four that move with stately bearing:</Line>
<Line number="30">a lion, mighty among beasts, who retreats before nothing;</Line>
<Line number="31">a strutting rooster, a he-goat, and a king with his army around him.</Line>
<Line number="32">"If you have played the fool and exalted yourself, or if you have planned evil, clap your hand over your mouth!</Line>
<Line number="33">For as churning the milk produces butter, and as twisting the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife."</Line>

<Chapter number="31">
<Line number="1">The sayings of King Lemuel--an oracle his mother taught him:</Line>
<Line number="2">"O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows,</Line>
<Line number="3">do not spend your strength on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings.</Line>
<Line number="4">"It is not for kings, O Lemuel--not for kings to drink wine, not for rulers to crave beer,</Line>
<Line number="5">lest they drink and forget what the law decrees, and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.</Line>
<Line number="6">Give beer to those who are perishing, wine to those who are in anguish;</Line>
<Line number="7">let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.</Line>
<Line number="8">"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.</Line>
<Line number="9">Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy."</Line>
<Line number="10">A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.</Line>
<Line number="11">Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.</Line>
<Line number="12">She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.</Line>
<Line number="13">She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.</Line>
<Line number="14">She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.</Line>
<Line number="15">She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls.</Line>
<Line number="16">She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.</Line>
<Line number="17">She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks.</Line>
<Line number="18">She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night.</Line>
<Line number="19">In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.</Line>
<Line number="20">She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy.</Line>
<Line number="21">When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet.</Line>
<Line number="22">She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.</Line>
<Line number="23">Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.</Line>
<Line number="24">She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes.</Line>
<Line number="25">She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.</Line>
<Line number="26">She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.</Line>
<Line number="27">She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.</Line>
<Line number="28">Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:</Line>
<Line number="29">"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all."</Line>
<Line number="30">Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</Line>
<Line number="31">Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.</Line>
